                "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nKlipper has recently introduced a very very cool feature called resonance compensation or input shaping, which can massively reduce the ringing introduced by vibrations in the motion system. Details can be found here: https://www.klipper3d.org/Resonance_Compensation.html\r\n\r\nIt would be awesome to have this feature in the Prusas. Does the i3 have enough processing power left to do something like this? If one assumes that e.g. all MK3 have close to the same characteristics, predetermined values could have a great effect then.\r\n\r\nNote that this is not the same feature as linearity correction or linear advance.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n",

Details can be found here: https://www.klipper3d.org/Resonance_Compensation.html\r\n\r\nIt would be awesome to have this feature in the Prusas. Does the i3 have enough processing power left to do something like this? If one assumes that e.g. all MK3 have close to the same characteristics, predetermined values could have a great effect then.\r\n\r\nNote that this is not the same feature as linearity correction or linear advance.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n",

While most of the features and fixes mentioned below were already included in the 3.13.2-RC1 release, we recommend updating to this firmware version.\r\n\r\n### Power Panic improvements\r\nThe primary focus of this release is to improve the Power Panic behavior, especially after the introduction of the new MMU3 firmware and the error states reported on the LCD of the printer.\r\n\r\nMulti-material prints tend to be very long, so any sort of power failure can put the quality of the print at stake.\r\n\r\nAny function that needs user interaction will pause the printer and move the hotend away from the print itself. This action prevents the hotend from \"scorching\" the print and creating blobs. It also creates space to investigate the reported issue or perform the requested action. Previously, the positions were saved to RAM, but these were lost during a power failure or a reset of the printer. This means the printer would try to continue with the print, but at the wrong height and wrong position. This caused mid-air extrusions, the creation of blobs, and sometimes missing extrusions.\r\n\r\nThis issue has now been resolved. All values in RAM (volatile) are saved to EEPROM (permanent) during a power panic which ensures a better power panic recovery during the MMU prints.        \r\n\r\nPower Panic recovery was tested for: \r\n- Paused print :heavy_check_mark: \r\n- MMU Error codes :heavy_check_mark: \r\n- After a crash :heavy_check_mark: \r\n- Filament runout :heavy_check_mark:\r\n- Filament change :heavy_check_mark: \r\n\r\n**Note: Power panic works only with SD card prints!**\r\n\r\n### MMU firmware improvements\r\nBased on the feedback from the community, this release brings new features allowing you to adjust parameters like idler sensitivity or bowden length.\r\n\r\n#### Added Tune menu for IDLER|SELECTOR CANNOT HOME\r\nMMU2S users have reported that, despite careful hardware inspection, some units struggle to home the Idler reliably. Although MMU Firmware 3.0.0 has already offered an option to adjust the Idler's homing sensitivity by modifying the StallGuard threshold, some users have encountered difficulties changing this value.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in case the MMU reports any of the \u201cIdler and/or Selector cannot home\u201d errors, there is a new option displayed on the screen called \"Tune\" which allows to set the threshold value in a user-friendly way. Please note that the allowed range of values has been limited to prevent users from accidentally setting extreme values.\r\n\r\n#### Bowden length register added\r\nWith the MMU FW 3.0.1, it is possible to set a custom front PTFE tube length (default length: 360 mm). This has been implemented at the request of our community members who pointed out that there are various configurations for the filament setup and there's a need to set a longer PTFE tube length. We limited the length to 1000 mm since longer tubes might introduce additional issues - we strongly recommend keeping the tube shorter rather than at the maximum allowable length.\r\n\r\nThis new register can be used to tweak the fast loading and unloading distance in case of non-standard installations. The register is persistent in the MMU's EEPROM. Unlike the previous generation of FW 1.0.x, the register now reflects the actual real length of the tube, not including any additional distances to the pulley or drive gears.\r\n\r\n**Note: If you choose to increase the PTFE length for your custom setup, you must verify whether the unloaded filaments fit inside the provided buffer. If they do not, you will need to construct your own buffer with sufficient space.**\r\n\r\n#### MMU USB product string updated\r\nIn the new firmware version 3.0.0 or later, which now supports both MMU2S and MMU3, the USB product string has been updated to \"Original Prusa MMU unit \ud83d\udc11.\" This change does not impact any of the MMU's functions.\r\n\r\n### Submitted by the Prusa community\r\nWe have implemented several improvements submitted by the active users from the Prusa Community. Many thanks to everyone involved.\r\n\r\n#### Enable/Disable FSensor using G-codes\r\nThis release brings support for enabling and disabling filament sensor (FSensor) using G-codes `M405/M406` submitted by @Commod0re\r\n\r\n#### Support for M118 G-code\r\nThe `M118` G-code was submitted by @RoboMagus see [here](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/pull/3946). The M118 G-code allows the sending of a message (Serial print) to hosts like OctoPrint and PrusaLink to trigger actions, etc. See the pull request for more information.\r\n\r\n#### Improved G-code M914 & M915 control (stealth mode)\r\nIn addition to enabling M914 and 915 by default, these codes have been expanded to allow for more flexible control of the current printing mode via G-code (such as enabling crash detection selectively during portions of a print).\r\n\r\nBy default, changes issued are temporary (lost on printer reset), but by supplying the 'P' parameter, the change can be saved to EEPROM and made persistent. Alternatively, supplying the `R` parameter will revert any current temporary changes in favor of the saved value. Finally, the menu has been updated to provide visual feedback when a temporary override is in place via G-code\r\n![Tune_Mode_M915](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/assets/25530011/0b9ed299-3767-4d75-ba34-22057dfd2351)\r\n\r\n### User interface improvements\r\n#### Jump to 200\u00b0C/50\u00b0C in Temperature menu\r\nThis release brings a new behavior when users manually set the temperature in the LCD Menu -> Settings -> Temperature menu. Previously, both nozzle (hotend) and heatbed temperatures started at 0 \u00b0C, and users had to rotate the knob clockwise to increase the temperature incrementally by 1 \u00b0C until the target temperature was reached.\r\n\r\nHowever, since most filaments require printing temperatures above 200/50 \u00b0C (nozzle/heatbed), we have made an adjustment. Now, starting at 0 \u00b0C, a single clockwise rotation will increase the nozzle temperature to 200\u00b0C instead of just 1 \u00b0C. The same change applies to setting the heatbed temperature (0 \u00b0C to 50 \u00b0C). This modification allows users to reach their target temperature more quickly.\r\n\r\nSimilar behavior is applied to the print fan; when turning the knob clockwise from 0, the speed is set to 127, which corresponds to 50% of the RPM range.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to revert to the original behavior, simply rotate the knob counterclockwise first, and then you can use it in the same way as before.\r\n\r\n#### Language Update information shown in the first row\r\nA minor change was introduced to avoid overwriting the version number during a language update.\r\n![FW3132_language_update](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/assets/25530011/614f06a5-a94f-4743-9565-6f1a05dab147)\r\n\r\n### Other improvements\r\n#### Simplified variant names\r\nIn the source code, we shortened the variant names to the minimum needed, as all Original Prusa MK2.5/S and MK3/S/+\r\n  - use 1.75mm filament\r\n  - use E3d v6 style hotends\r\n  - All MK3/S/+ use the same controller board\r\n- Exceptions are\r\n  - MK2.5/S may have a RAMbo10a or a RAMbo13a board which have different pinouts\r\n  - 3rd party modification\r\n\r\n#### Code optimization\r\nWe optimized the source code and freed up some space for future features.\r\n\r\n#### Update development tools\r\nThe development/compiling tools `cmake` and `PF-build.sh` have been updated.\r\nMore information about the build is now shown in the LCD Support menu:\r\n![More_LCD_Support_information](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/assets/25530011/a9e0733d-705f-48dd-b670-c8f3c4445dd4)\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n- Fixed a false FINDA runout event at the start of an MMU print on MK3S printers https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/pull/4332 (Kudos goes to @mmoraes80, @sruggier and @Braddg for helping us narrow down the problem and verify the fix)\r\n- Fixed an issue with Preheat heating for longer than intended https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/pull/4338 (Kudos to @linzwatt for reporting the issue and to @sarusani for fixing it)\r\n- Fixed an issue where some users could not run first layer calibration because the LCD was stuck rendering the same fullscreen message repeatedly (Kudos to @sarusani for helping us test and fix this)\r\n- Fixed an issue where a print could be started while the printer is still loading or unloading filament, triggering a firmware crash. https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/pull/3564\r\n- Previously in FW 3.13.2-RC1 reported FAN check issue has been fixed.",

I had seen that message after the firmware update before but it didn't actually register what it was saying (I thought it was a standard bootup message). After installing the [correct firmware for the MK3S+](https://help.prusa3d.com/downloads/mk3s/firmware) autoload is working again.\r\n\r\nThis is absolutely my error, but I'm wondering if stronger wording on the message might have woken me up. Maybe start with a big \"WARNING\" or something similar? I'm curious if this is the same issue for you @Coffeeroast @PGlyre @octopuss?",

                "body": "@WhiteGooseFab There is no concern about the motor's temperature. This aspect was brought to our attention in many different ways and all the time proved to be not relevant, so, I have reason to believe it doesn't play a role in this specific issue either.\r\nThanks for sharing though.\r\n\r\n@reivaxy The noise is not a concern for the printer functionality and it should be expected but tuning the Stall Guard threshold on a flawless assembly can help reduce noise.\r\nAgain, the tuning options will be available in the next stable FW release (the testing version is already available).\r\nThe description of \"really really tight\" doesn't tell much but it sounds like something is wrong with the assembly because, on the contrary, only gentle pressure is required for the idler barrel to stay in place without deforming.\r\nThe new firmware is 100% compatible. Please reach our support for troubleshooting.\r\n\r\n@reivaxy @hjvooijen Further hardware tweaking shouldn't really be necessary as the MMU2S can work as it is, and the MMU3 upgrade is also available for the ones who want to upgrade. Also, hardware tweaking doesn't concern this GitHub repository, which is almost exclusively dedicated to the firmware.\r\nAs explained in the [blog post](https://blog.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-mmu3-is-here-multi-material-printing-with-improvements-all-around-now-shipping_80485/), for the MMU3 _hardware_ enhancement, our developers and designers took inspiration from the Printables and Thingiverse popular mods (and not only), and the conversations in our forum and popular groups on Socials raised their awareness of these.\r\nWe appreciate your efforts but I hope you can understand that the MMU3 Upgrade renders MMU2S hardware considerations obsolete. Moreover, hardware considerations are not directly relevant to this specific repository.\r\nPlease feel free to share your findings on already existing relevant topics of our forum (you can open a new one if there are none).\r\n\r\nMichele Moramarco\r\nPrusa Research",

                "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nKlipper has recently introduced a very very cool feature called resonance compensation or input shaping, which can massively reduce the ringing introduced by vibrations in the motion system. Details can be found here: https://www.klipper3d.org/Resonance_Compensation.html\r\n\r\nIt would be awesome to have this feature in the Prusas. Does the i3 have enough processing power left to do something like this? If one assumes that e.g. all MK3 have close to the same characteristics, predetermined values could have a great effect then.\r\n\r\nNote that this is not the same feature as linearity correction or linear advance.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n",

I monitor my prints via Octoprint.\r\n\r\nI built a Lack enclosure to help printing. A simple preheat before printing will bring all temperatures into range. We even wrote a gcode that will ensure the ambient temperature is right before starting to print.\r\n\r\nWith the current MINTEMP setup the printer just refuses to start taking commands from octoprint, as it reports an error.\r\n  \r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nIt would be ideal to be able to configure the Minimal temperature, I would set it up to 10 degrees or whichever temperature that my environment supports. \r\n\r\nAlternatively It would be good to setup whether mintemp should be an error or just a warning on the display. \r\n\r\nDisabling the check is also a possibility but I read that this check can also detect cabling problems, for which just tuning the temperature would be the best solution.\r\n",

Details can be found here: https://www.klipper3d.org/Resonance_Compensation.html\r\n\r\nIt would be awesome to have this feature in the Prusas. Does the i3 have enough processing power left to do something like this? If one assumes that e.g. all MK3 have close to the same characteristics, predetermined values could have a great effect then.\r\n\r\nNote that this is not the same feature as linearity correction or linear advance.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n",

Please describe.**\r\nI was recently asked by Prusa Support to do a factory reset as part of diagnosing/resolving a problem. This would mean losing the per-sheet live-z values for all the steel sheets I have set up. It would be a tedious and time-consuming task to recalibrate all the sheets. Luckily we were able to solve the problem without resorting to factory reset, but I would prefer to be able to do a factory reset when needed without a terrible penalty to get the printer set up again afterwards.\r\n  \r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would like some mechanism for backing up and restoring settings like the per-sheet live-z. In the first instance, this could be via gcodes to be issued at a terminal, although integration with PrusaSlicer/flashing would be great - eg, \"flash and factory reset\", with checkboxes for which settings to retain. This feature should be available for all settings which are determined by user intervention (as opposed to by automatic self-calibration).\r\n",
