The result is the `TestNotifier_ManyConsumers` test takes ~100s to run locally.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes 2 improvements:\r\n* Run the `TestNotifier_ManyConsumers` test in parallel with other tests. Currently the subtests are in parallel with eachother, but the main test runs serially.\r\n* Remove the 100ms sleep, and use a channel to synchronize the test.\r\n\r\nFrom local testing, this test originally took ~102s, and runs in 1.2s after the change",

                "body": "The engine notifier's unit tests are slow because they do many iterations, each with a 100ms pause. The result is the `TestNotifier_ManyConsumers` test takes ~100s to run locally.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes 2 improvements:\r\n* Run the `TestNotifier_ManyConsumers` test in parallel with other tests. Currently the subtests are in parallel with eachother, but the main test runs serially.\r\n* Remove the 100ms sleep, and use a channel to synchronize the test.\r\n\r\nFrom local testing, this test originally took ~102s, and runs in 1.2s after the change",
