Looking at the logs, the output is:\r\n```\r\nError: LinkageError occurred while loading main class build.buildfarm.worker.shard.Worker\r\n\tjava.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: build/buildfarm/worker/shard/Worker has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 61.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 55.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the tag `latest` is replaced with `v2.6.1` the problem goes away. I couldn't find a place in the code where the container is pushed, so I suspect this is done externally (but happy to stand corrected if I missed something).\r\n\r\nI suspect the cause is that the process that builds the code that goes in the container has a locally installed Java 17 toolchain, which is picked up by Bazel. If that's the case, the solution should be to make the Java build hermetic with the following:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/.bazelrc b/.bazelrc\r\nindex adbb3c68..79b97837 100644\r\n--- a/.bazelrc\r\n+++ b/.bazelrc\r\n@@ -1,3 +1,9 @@\r\n+build --java_language_version=11\r\n+build --java_runtime_version=remotejdk_11\r\n+\r\n+build --tool_java_language_version=11\r\n+build --tool_java_runtime_version=remotejdk_11\r\n+\r\n common --enable_platform_specific_config\r\n \r\n build:fuse --define=fuse=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother possibility I considered would be to update the base images to use Java 17, which seem to be already available:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/BUILD b/BUILD\r\nindex f552ea9d..688dd0f4 100644\r\n--- a/BUILD\r\n+++ b/BUILD\r\n@@ -148,14 +148,14 @@ oss_audit(\r\n # Download cgroup-tools so that the worker is able to restrict actions via control groups.\r\n download_pkgs(\r\n     name = \"worker_pkgs\",\r\n-    image_tar = \"@ubuntu-jammy//image\",\r\n+    image_tar = \"@ubuntu-mantic//image\",\r\n     packages = [\"cgroup-tools\"],\r\n     tags = [\"container\"],\r\n )\r\n\r\n install_pkgs(\r\n     name = \"worker_pkgs_image\",\r\n-    image_tar = \"@ubuntu-jammy//image\",\r\n+    image_tar = \"@ubuntu-mantic//image\",\r\n     installables_tar = \":worker_pkgs.tar\",\r\n     installation_cleanup_commands = \"rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\",\r\n     output_image_name = \"worker_pkgs_image\",\r\ndiff --git a/images.bzl b/images.bzl\r\nindex 9ab0a8b0..c6c76739 100644\r\n--- a/images.bzl\r\n+++ b/images.bzl\r\n@@ -27,19 +27,11 @@ def buildfarm_images():\r\n     )\r\n\r\n     container_pull(\r\n-        name = \"ubuntu-bionic\",\r\n-        digest = \"sha256:4bc527c7a288da405f2041928c63d0a6479a120ad63461c2f124c944def54be2\",\r\n+        name = \"ubuntu-mantic\",\r\n+        digest = \"sha256:1419bba15470a95242e917b3abcd8981ae36707b99df5ac705e1eee4d920c51c\",\r\n         registry = \"index.docker.io\",\r\n         repository = \"bazelbuild/buildfarm-worker-base\",\r\n-        tag = \"bionic-java11-gcc\",\r\n-    )\r\n-\r\n-    container_pull(\r\n-        name = \"ubuntu-jammy\",\r\n-        digest = \"sha256:da847ee259ebe7f00631a2f0146d9add60ff0f94b031a2e522ce94c78b1335c2\",\r\n-        registry = \"index.docker.io\",\r\n-        repository = \"bazelbuild/buildfarm-worker-base\",\r\n-        tag = \"jammy-java11-gcc\",\r\n+        tag = \"mantic-java17-gcc\",\r\n     )\r\n\r\n     container_pull(\r\n```\r\n\r\nStill, even in this case I think it would probably be advisable to pin the Java toolchain to use Java 17.\r\n\r\nHappy to hear back from the maintainers and contribute with a PR based on that. \ud83d\ude42 ",

Indeed, situations like this misconfiguration should not occur or occur very rarely.However, once it happens, it results in the strange situation which requiring manual intervention from the backplane to resolve the issue. Ideally, I hope to set a timeout for the operations in the OperationQueue, such as OperationQueueTimeout. When scanning the queue, if we find that a task has been stalled for too long, we can terminate that operation and notify the client that the task has timed out. this differs from the actual execution timeout configuration, known as defaultActionTimeout. OperationQueueTimeout represents the maximum timeout for tasks that cannot be consumed, while defaultActionTimeout represents tasks that can be consumed but may time out during execution. However, this is just a possible suggestion. If necessary, I may try to fix this issue locally first. If there are further ideas in the future, we can continue the discussion.\r\n",

                "body": "I'm on an M1 Mac running macOS Sonoma and Docker Desktop 4.24.2.\r\n\r\nWhen running `examples/bf-run start`, the worker container stops immediately. Looking at the logs, the output is:\r\n```\r\nError: LinkageError occurred while loading main class build.buildfarm.worker.shard.Worker\r\n\tjava.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: build/buildfarm/worker/shard/Worker has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 61.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 55.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the tag `latest` is replaced with `v2.6.1` the problem goes away. I couldn't find a place in the code where the container is pushed, so I suspect this is done externally (but happy to stand corrected if I missed something).\r\n\r\nI suspect the cause is that the process that builds the code that goes in the container has a locally installed Java 17 toolchain, which is picked up by Bazel. If that's the case, the solution should be to make the Java build hermetic with the following:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/.bazelrc b/.bazelrc\r\nindex adbb3c68..79b97837 100644\r\n--- a/.bazelrc\r\n+++ b/.bazelrc\r\n@@ -1,3 +1,9 @@\r\n+build --java_language_version=11\r\n+build --java_runtime_version=remotejdk_11\r\n+\r\n+build --tool_java_language_version=11\r\n+build --tool_java_runtime_version=remotejdk_11\r\n+\r\n common --enable_platform_specific_config\r\n \r\n build:fuse --define=fuse=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother possibility I considered would be to update the base images to use Java 17, which seem to be already available:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/BUILD b/BUILD\r\nindex f552ea9d..688dd0f4 100644\r\n--- a/BUILD\r\n+++ b/BUILD\r\n@@ -148,14 +148,14 @@ oss_audit(\r\n # Download cgroup-tools so that the worker is able to restrict actions via control groups.\r\n download_pkgs(\r\n     name = \"worker_pkgs\",\r\n-    image_tar = \"@ubuntu-jammy//image\",\r\n+    image_tar = \"@ubuntu-mantic//image\",\r\n     packages = [\"cgroup-tools\"],\r\n     tags = [\"container\"],\r\n )\r\n\r\n install_pkgs(\r\n     name = \"worker_pkgs_image\",\r\n-    image_tar = \"@ubuntu-jammy//image\",\r\n+    image_tar = \"@ubuntu-mantic//image\",\r\n     installables_tar = \":worker_pkgs.tar\",\r\n     installation_cleanup_commands = \"rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\",\r\n     output_image_name = \"worker_pkgs_image\",\r\ndiff --git a/images.bzl b/images.bzl\r\nindex 9ab0a8b0..c6c76739 100644\r\n--- a/images.bzl\r\n+++ b/images.bzl\r\n@@ -27,19 +27,11 @@ def buildfarm_images():\r\n     )\r\n\r\n     container_pull(\r\n-        name = \"ubuntu-bionic\",\r\n-        digest = \"sha256:4bc527c7a288da405f2041928c63d0a6479a120ad63461c2f124c944def54be2\",\r\n+        name = \"ubuntu-mantic\",\r\n+        digest = \"sha256:1419bba15470a95242e917b3abcd8981ae36707b99df5ac705e1eee4d920c51c\",\r\n         registry = \"index.docker.io\",\r\n         repository = \"bazelbuild/buildfarm-worker-base\",\r\n-        tag = \"bionic-java11-gcc\",\r\n-    )\r\n-\r\n-    container_pull(\r\n-        name = \"ubuntu-jammy\",\r\n-        digest = \"sha256:da847ee259ebe7f00631a2f0146d9add60ff0f94b031a2e522ce94c78b1335c2\",\r\n-        registry = \"index.docker.io\",\r\n-        repository = \"bazelbuild/buildfarm-worker-base\",\r\n-        tag = \"jammy-java11-gcc\",\r\n+        tag = \"mantic-java17-gcc\",\r\n     )\r\n\r\n     container_pull(\r\n```\r\n\r\nStill, even in this case I think it would probably be advisable to pin the Java toolchain to use Java 17.\r\n\r\nHappy to hear back from the maintainers and contribute with a PR based on that. \ud83d\ude42 ",
