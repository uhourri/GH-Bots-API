Most open\n-source software is released under one or more common open source licenses.\n-Specifying the specific license that a package is released under in a project's\n-`package.py` is good practice. To specify a license, find the SPDX identifier for\n-a project and then add it using the license directive:\n+Most of the software in Spack is open source, and most open source software is released\n+under one or more `common open source licenses <https://opensource.org/licenses/>`_.\n+Specifying the license that a package is released under in a project's\n+`package.py` is good practice. To specify a license, find the `SPDX identifier\n+<https://spdx.org/licenses/>`_ for a project and then add it using the license\n+directive:\n \n .. code-block:: python\n \n    license(\"<SPDX Identifier HERE>\")\n \n+For example, the SPDX ID for the Apache Software License, version 2.0 is ``Apache-2.0``,\n+so you'd write:\n+\n+.. code-block:: python\n+\n+   license(\"Apache-2.0\")\n+\n+Or, for a dual-licensed package like Spack, you would use an `SPDX Expression\n+<https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2-draft/SPDX-license-expressions/>`_ with both of its\n+licenses:\n+\n+.. code-block:: python\n+\n+   license(\"Apache-2.0 OR MIT\")\n+\n Note that specifying a license without a when clause makes it apply to all\n versions and variants of the package, which might not actually be the case.\n For example, a project might have switched licenses at some point or have\n certain build configurations that include files that are licensed differently.\n-To account for this, you can specify when licenses should be applied. For\n-example, to specify that a specific license identifier should only apply\n-to versionup to and including 1.5, you could write the following directive:\n+Spack itself used to be under the ``LGPL-2.1`` license, until it was relicensed\n+in version ``0.12`` in 2018.\n+\n+You can specify when a ``license()`` directive applies using with a ``when=``\n+clause, just like other directives. For example, to specify that a specific\n+license identifier should only apply to versions up to ``0.11``, but another\n+license should apply for later veresions, you could write:",

No sure there are no other issues in 1.10.0 though, since XCode 14 is pretty new, but it will likely work.\r\n\r\n> Also, any other build deps you think we can relax the upper bounds on? That may make it easier to concretizer newer versions.\r\n\r\nIIRC the `meson-python` and `pythran` upper bounds can safely be removed, while there was one issue with `pybind11` around 2.10.4/2.11, so that may best be left untouched.",

                "body": "This bumped macOS to scipy 1.8.1 but now there's a new issue that proves that Spack's concretizer is too smart for its own good. Scipy 1.8.1 requires pythran 0.10, which doesn't support Apple Clang 13+ (#30734). So Spack decides to build everything with Apple Clang 15 except Pythran, which it builds with GCC. This then fails when Apple Clang 15 tries to link Scipy to Pythran.\r\n\r\nSome possible solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Add Apple Clang 13+ conflict to scipy 1.8 (I don't like this)\r\n2. Relax the upper bounds on the Pythran dep version (quickest fix but doesn't really solve the concretizer bug)\r\n3. Remove GCC from the macOS CI compiler list (don't know how to do, but would help debug builds)\r\n4. Add a mechanism to declare a conflict not only for a package but those that depend on it as well (hardest to do but most technically correct)\r\n\r\nCurious if @eugeneswalker has thoughts on 3 or @alalazo has thoughts on 4. I'll try 2 for now to get the tests passing. This might even let us build newer versions of scipy in CI.",

This makes it difficult to use multiple instances of spack cleanly. \n\n### Description\n\nRequesting that sourcing a spack setup scripts first cleans up/unsets any old spack shell manipulations. \r\n\r\nA second related request would be a \u2018spack goodbye\u2019 command that uses can call to drop shell support for an active shell. Akin to typing \u2018exit\u2019 in the shell but just for spack features. \n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
