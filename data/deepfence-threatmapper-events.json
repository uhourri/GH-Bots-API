E.g. Host. \r\n**mask_image_tag**: This is to apply mask for an image and tag. \r\n\r\nWe will need to send these enums in the request param as follows:\r\n`mask_action: \"<mask_enum>\"`. E.g.  `mask_action: \"mask_global\"`\r\n\r\nAlso, I have removed the `mask_across_hosts_and_images` flag from the request. We will be using the `mask_global` enum instead.",
