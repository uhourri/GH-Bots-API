That is a problem, as the block editor attempts to render the Pods block output while still typing the parameters.\r\n\r\nScreenshot 1 - the Pods Item List returns some items, fine.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/assets/17141205/d9732fbd-6386-4c0f-88cf-079a541fbe31)\r\n\r\nScreenshot 2 - after starting to type `t.post_title ASC` in the `Order By`\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/assets/17141205/04eb9703-bb9d-45d8-ad50-160d29fe8261)\r\n\r\nI think that affects all the SQL parameters but I specifically experienced it on the _limit, where and order_ by.\r\n\r\nThe only resort is to exit the editor and cancel saving.\r\n\r\nIs that something you can reproduce?\n\n### Version\n\n3.0.7\n\n### Testing Instructions\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots / Screencast\n\n_No response_\n\n### Possible Workaround\n\nCan be worked around by coping and pasting in a finished _where_ or _order by_ clause from another text editor.\n\n### Site Health Information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Pods Package\n\n_No response_",
