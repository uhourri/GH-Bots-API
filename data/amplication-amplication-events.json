It also refactors the data-service-generator tests to use a shared test data object.\n\n> _To generate data services with ease_\n> _We added some modules and actions, you see_\n> _We used types and

It also implies the changes to the plugin interfaces to use the `entityActions` parameter.\n2.  \ud83c\udd95 - This emoji represents the addition of new features and functionality, such as the `removeClassMethodByName` function, the `entityActions` type, and the generation of controller modules for custom actions.\n3.  \ud83d\udd10 - This emoji represents the changes to the permissions logic and the `setEndpointPermissions` function, which now handles the case when a class method is removed by the `removeClassMethodByName` function. It also implies the security aspect of the custom actions and their permissions.\n-->\nThis pull request adds support for custom actions on entities in the data service generator. It refactors some utility functions and types to handle the actions metadata and logic. It also updates the code generation plugins to use the new `entityActions` parameter. It modifies the controller modules to include the custom actions and remove the default actions if needed. It changes some types and functions in the `amplication-code-gen-types` and `util/dsg-utils` libraries.\n\n> _`entityActions`_\n> _More data for controllers_\n> _Spring brings new features_\n\n### Walkthrough\n*  Move imports of pluralize and camelCase from `entity-util.ts` to `libs/util/dsg-utils/src/lib/entity-util.ts` and add imports of camelCase, pascalCase and pluralize to the latter file
