I did test the query log entries yesterday and all five of the YouTube domains showed up under Safe Search in Query Log. They showed up for the iOS devices which do exhibit the problem and they also showed up for the Windows laptop which does not exhibit the problem.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am surprised at how many blockages I get from the Apple devices regarding blocking the Apple DoH servers. That has been eye-opening.\r\n\r\n**Summary:** This problem only seems to affect iOS devices and it only seems to affect the Desktop Website version of YouTube on Safari. This especially affects iPads the most because they load the Desktop Website version of YouTube by default due to screen size. iPhones are only affected it the user specifically chooses Request Desktop Website. iPads are affected by default by viewing YouTube on Safari.",

I have all DoH servers blocked now via domain name and via IP addresses.\r\n\r\nThe issue still persists (only iOS devices) and I can reproduce this 100% of the time.\r\n\r\niPhone or iPad:\r\n\r\n- Go to YouTube.com in Safari\r\n- Request Desktop Website\r\n- Content Restrictions: Off\r\n- Request Mobile Website\r\n- Content Restrictions: On\r\n\r\niPhone uses mobile website by default. iPad uses desktop website by default because of the bigger screen size.\r\n\r\nRegardless of iPhone or iPad, it is this switching back and forth via Request Desktop Website / Request Mobile Website that is triggering the Content Protection on and off. Although for iPads, the protection is off initially since it uses desktop website.\r\n\r\nCan you try that in an attempt to reproduce the issue?\r\n\r\nThank you.",
