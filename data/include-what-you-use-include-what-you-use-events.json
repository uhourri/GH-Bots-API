Same if the test is running with a non-`arm64` target - support for the arm64 target would somehow be polluting the behavior of the target being used.\r\n\r\nThe final case to consider is when the test asks for `-target arm64`: the prerequisite would be saying the test is invalid if IWYU has support for target. That's clearly a contradiction.\r\n\r\nObviously it should be accepted syntax. If it reads wrong, I don't think that's not the worst thing - as it will make the reviewer think a bit more (hopefully). What must read well is the positive case `IWYU_REQUIRES: supports-target(arm64)`",

The following text is evaluated as python code - if the result is true, the test is skipped.\r\n\r\nI was looking at whether I could silence the `ms_inline_asm`, but saw the discussion on #1201. I'm not sure whether you'd prefer to set --target=x86_64, or mark the test for skipping with something like this. The infrastructure may come in handy to skip over tests that we can't get to work with libstdc++ or clang_mapping.",

The following text is evaluated as python code - if the result is true, the test is skipped.\r\n\r\nI was looking at whether I could silence the `ms_inline_asm`, but saw the discussion on #1201. I'm not sure whether you'd prefer to set --target=x86_64, or mark the test for skipping with something like this. The infrastructure may come in handy to skip over tests that we can't get to work with libstdc++ or clang_mapping.",
