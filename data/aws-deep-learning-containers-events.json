Optimizations take advantage of AVX-512 Vector Neural Network Instructions (AVX512 VNNI) and Intel\u00ae Advanced Matrix Extensions (Intel\u00ae AMX) on Intel CPUs\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n- [x] I've prepended PR tag with frameworks/job this applies to : [mxnet, tensorflow, pytorch] | [ei/neuron/graviton] | [build] | [test] | [benchmark] | [ec2, ecs, eks, sagemaker]\r\n- [ ] If the PR changes affects SM test, I've modified dlc_developer_config.toml in my PR branch by setting sagemaker_tests = true and efa_tests = true\r\n- [ ] If this PR changes existing code, the change fully backward compatible with pre-existing code. (Non backward-compatible changes need special approval.)\r\n- [ ] (If applicable) I've documented below the DLC image/dockerfile this relates to\r\n- [ ] (If applicable) I've documented below the tests I've run on the DLC image\r\n- [ ] (If applicable) I've reviewed the licenses of updated and new binaries and their dependencies to make sure all licenses are on the Apache Software Foundation Third Party License Policy Category A or Category B license list.

(Non backward-compatible changes need special approval.)\n- [ ] (If applicable) I've documented below the DLC image/dockerfile this relates to\n- [ ] (If applicable) I've documented below the tests I've run on the DLC image\n- [ ] (If applicable) I've reviewed the licenses of updated and new binaries and their dependencies to make sure all licenses are on the Apache Software Foundation Third Party License Policy Category A or Category B license list.  See [https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html).\n- [ ] (If applicable) I've scanned the updated and new binaries to make sure they do not have vulnerabilities associated with them.\n\n## Pytest Marker Checklist\n- [ ] (If applicable) I have added the marker `@pytest.mark.model(\"<model-type>\")` to the new tests which I have added, to specify the Deep Learning model that is used in the test (use `\"N/A\"` if the test doesn't use a model)\n- [ ] (If applicable) I have added the marker `@pytest.mark.integration(\"<feature-being-tested>\")` to the new tests which I have added, to specify the feature that will be tested\n- [ ] (If applicable) I have added the marker `@pytest.mark.multinode(<integer-num-nodes>)` to the new tests which I have added, to specify the number of nodes used on a multi-node test\n- [ ] (If applicable) I have added the marker `@pytest.mark.processor(<\"cpu\"/\"gpu\"/\"eia\"/\"neuron\">)` to the new tests which I have added, if a test is specifically applicable to only one processor type\n\n#### EIA/NEURON/GRAVITON Testing Checklist\n* When creating a PR:\n- [ ] I've modified `dlc_developer_config.toml` in my PR branch by setting `ei_mode = true`, `neuron_mode = true` or `graviton_mode = true`\n\n#### Benchmark Testing Checklist\n* When creating a PR:\n- [ ] I've modified `dlc_developer_config.toml` in my PR branch by setting `benchmark_mode = true`\n\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.
