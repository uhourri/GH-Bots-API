So `items.0.name` won't work, and needs to be changed to `items[0].name`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by changing any key indexes to array notation just before we output `x-model` and `x-modelable` on the root element.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!",

Did you create a discussion about it first?**\r\n\r\nYes, enhancing compatibility is always beneficial as it promotes interoperability with a wider array of packages. \r\nNo discussion was created.\r\n\r\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 Did you create a branch for your fix/feature? (Master branch PR's will be closed)**\r\n\r\nYes, a separate branch named `add-testcase-compatibility` has been created for this purpose.\r\n\r\n**3\ufe0f\u20e3 Does it contain multiple, unrelated changes? Please separate the PRs out.**\r\n\r\nNo, this PR solely focuses on enhancing compatibility by utilizing the `PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase` class.\r\n\r\n**4\ufe0f\u20e3 Does it include tests? (Required)**\r\n\r\nNo, existing tests continue to pass with these changes, serving primarily to extend compatibility with other packages/projects, ensuring seamless integration as they evolve.\r\n\r\n**5\ufe0f\u20e3 Please include a thorough description (including small code snippets if possible) of the improvement and reasons why it's useful.**\r\n\r\nTesting Livewire components or integrations within packages can sometimes pose challenges. This PR aims to streamline this process, enabling developers to leverage the Livewire testing infrastructure for a broader range of testing scenarios. This change is fairly straightforward yet significantly impactful.\r\n\r\n```php\r\nLivewire::visit(new class() extends Component\r\n{\r\n    public $color = '#000';\r\n\r\n    public function render(): string\r\n    {\r\n        return <<<'BLADE'\r\n            <div>\r\n                <x-color-picker label=\"Color Picker\" name=\"color\" wire:model=\"color\" />\r\n            </div>\r\n        BLADE;\r\n    }\r\n})\r\n    ->waitForAlpineJs()\r\n    ->assertInputValue('color', '#000');\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy adhering to PHPUnit's native TestCase class, we foster a more standardized approach, which in turn facilitates integration with other packages. This is particularly useful for projects that rely on a variety of packages and aim for a cohesive working environment.\r\n\r\nThanks for this awesome package! \ud83d\ude4c",

Did you create a discussion about it first?**\r\n\r\nYes, enhancing compatibility is always beneficial as it promotes interoperability with a wider array of packages. \r\nNo discussion was created.\r\n\r\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 Did you create a branch for your fix/feature? (Master branch PR's will be closed)**\r\n\r\nYes, a separate branch named `add-testcase-compatibility` has been created for this purpose.\r\n\r\n**3\ufe0f\u20e3 Does it contain multiple, unrelated changes? Please separate the PRs out.**\r\n\r\nNo, this PR solely focuses on enhancing compatibility by utilizing the `PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase` class.\r\n\r\n**4\ufe0f\u20e3 Does it include tests? (Required)**\r\n\r\nNo, existing tests continue to pass with these changes, serving primarily to extend compatibility with other packages/projects, ensuring seamless integration as they evolve.\r\n\r\n**5\ufe0f\u20e3 Please include a thorough description (including small code snippets if possible) of the improvement and reasons why it's useful.**\r\n\r\nTesting Livewire components or integrations within packages can sometimes pose challenges. This PR aims to streamline this process, enabling developers to leverage the Livewire testing infrastructure for a broader range of testing scenarios. This change is fairly straightforward yet significantly impactful.\r\n\r\n```php\r\nLivewire::visit(new class() extends Component\r\n{\r\n    public $color = '#000';\r\n\r\n    public function render(): string\r\n    {\r\n        return <<<'BLADE'\r\n            <div>\r\n                <x-color-picker label=\"Color Picker\" name=\"color\" wire:model=\"color\" />\r\n            </div>\r\n        BLADE;\r\n    }\r\n})\r\n    ->waitForAlpineJs()\r\n    ->assertInputValue('color', '#000');\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy adhering to PHPUnit's native TestCase class, we foster a more standardized approach, which in turn facilitates integration with other packages. This is particularly useful for projects that rely on a variety of packages and aim for a cohesive working environment.\r\n\r\nThanks for this awesome package! \ud83d\ude4c",

Tags provide a way to manage and invalidate cached data associated with specific entities within your application.\r\n\r\nIf the current cache driver supports tags, you then can do something like.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n#[Computed(cache: true, tags: ['posts'])]\r\npublic function latestPosts(): Collection\r\n{\r\n\t// Caching because this is global\r\n\treturn Post::latest()->take(10)->get();\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[Computed(persist: true, tags: ['posts'])]\r\npublic function ownPosts(): Collection\r\n{\r\n\t// Persisting because this is scoped to the current instance of the Livewire component\r\n\treturn Auth::user()->posts()->latest()->take(10)->get();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen a Post-model is updated/deleted/restored then we clear the caching tag 'posts':\r\n`Cache::tags('posts')->flush();`\r\nAfter the next refresh, we get a fresh copy, instead of the outdated cached one.\r\n\r\nPlease see the modified UnitTest for detailed test cacse",

Tags provide a way to manage and invalidate cached data associated with specific entities within your application.\r\n\r\nIf the current cache driver supports tags, you then can do something like.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n#[Computed(cache: true, tags: ['posts'])]\r\npublic function latestPosts(): Collection\r\n{\r\n\t// Caching because this is global\r\n\treturn Post::latest()->take(10)->get();\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[Computed(persist: true, tags: ['posts'])]\r\npublic function ownPosts(): Collection\r\n{\r\n\t// Persisting because this is scoped to the current instance of the Livewire component\r\n\treturn Auth::user()->posts()->latest()->take(10)->get();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen a Post-model is updated/deleted/restored then we clear the caching tag 'posts':\r\n`Cache::tags('posts')->flush();`\r\nAfter the next refresh, we get a fresh copy, instead of the outdated cached one.\r\n\r\nPlease see the modified UnitTest for detailed test cacse",

Tags provide a way to manage and invalidate cached data associated with specific entities within your application.\r\n\r\nIf the current cache driver supports tags, you then can do something like.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n#[Computed(cache: true, tags: ['posts'])]\r\npublic function latestPosts(): Collection\r\n{\r\n\t// Caching because this is global\r\n\treturn Post::latest()->take(10)->get();\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[Computed(persist: true, tags: ['posts'])]\r\npublic function ownPosts(): Collection\r\n{\r\n\t// Persisting because this is scoped to the current instance of the Livewire component\r\n\treturn Auth::user()->posts()->latest()->take(10)->get();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen a Post-model is updated/deleted/restored then we clear the caching tag 'posts':\r\n`Cache::tags('posts')->flush();`\r\nAfter the next refresh, we get a fresh copy, instead of the outdated cached one.\r\n\r\nPlease see the modified UnitTest for detailed test cacse",
