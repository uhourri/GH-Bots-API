In order to refund the same amount you'd have to pass in `refund_fee_amount: 600` because `#localized_amount` (https://github.com/activemerchant/active_merchant/blob/master/lib/active_merchant/billing/gateway.rb#L269) divides the value by 100 before it gets passed to the Stripe API.\r\n\r\nActiveMerchant version: 1.90",

This is an easy mistake for new merchants to make.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n- have an account in Card Present mode\r\n- for AIM just charge a card, or for CIM, store a customer, store a payment profile, then charge the profile\r\n- note that the return (see below for CIM example) says resultCode=Ok and code=I00001 (success) and text=\"Successful.\"\r\n- no money was captured\r\n\r\nSo, currently, all users of ActiveMerchant (at least those that let other people enter their own authorize.net account) must add protection against this issue.\r\n\r\nDesired change:\r\n- have ActiveMerchant test for this condition and instead return failure\r\n\r\nBelow is a raw response for charging a stored CIM profile on a Card Present account:\r\n<createCustomerProfileTransactionResponse xmlns:xsi=\\\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\\\" xmlns:xsd=\\\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\\\" xmlns=\\\"AnetApi/xml/v1/schema/AnetApiSchema.xsd\\\"><messages><resultCode>Ok</resultCode><message><code>I00001</code><text>Successful.</text></message></messages><directResponse>1.0,3,87,Transactions of this market type cannot be processed on this system.,,P,,0,74078B398622E4FBDC0FB5469D7A2054,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</directResponse></createCustomerProfileTransactionResponse>\r\n\r\nAnd the resulting ActiveMerchant::Billing::Response, note that it even provides a (blank) transaction_id field, making it easy to store this field and consider the result a success:\r\n=> #<ActiveMerchant::Billing::Response:0x0055a0a0b8bd20 @params={\"messages\"=>{\"result_code\"=>\"Ok\", \"message\"=>{\"code\"=>\"I00001\", \"text\"=>\"Successful.\"}}, \"direct_response\"=>{\"raw\"=>\"1.0,3,87,Transactions of this market type cannot be processed on this system.,,P,,0,74078B398622E4FBDC0FB5469D7A2054,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\", \"response_code\"=>\"1.0\", \"response_subcode\"=>\"3\", \"response_reason_code\"=>\"87\", \"message\"=>\"Transactions of this market type cannot be processed on this system.\", \"approval_code\"=>\"\", \"avs_response\"=>\"P\", \"transaction_id\"=>\"\", \"invoice_number\"=>\"0\", \"order_description\"=>\"74078B398622E4FBDC0FB5469D7A2054\", \"amount\"=>nil, \"method\"=>nil, \"transaction_type\"=>nil, \"customer_id\"=>nil, \"first_name\"=>nil, \"last_name\"=>nil, \"company\"=>nil, \"address\"=>nil, \"city\"=>nil, \"state\"=>nil, \"zip_code\"=>nil, \"country\"=>nil, \"phone\"=>nil, \"fax\"=>nil, \"email_address\"=>nil, \"ship_to_first_name\"=>nil, \"ship_to_last_name\"=>nil, \"ship_to_company\"=>nil, \"ship_to_address\"=>nil, \"ship_to_city\"=>nil, \"ship_to_state\"=>nil, \"ship_to_zip_code\"=>nil, \"ship_to_country\"=>nil, \"tax\"=>nil, \"duty\"=>nil, \"freight\"=>nil, \"tax_exempt\"=>nil, \"purchase_order_number\"=>nil, \"md5_hash\"=>nil, \"card_code\"=>nil, \"cardholder_authentication_verification_response\"=>nil, \"account_number\"=>\"\", \"card_type\"=>\"\", \"split_tender_id\"=>\"\", \"requested_amount\"=>\"\", \"balance_on_card\"=>\"\"}}, @message=\"Successful.\", @success=true, @test=false, @authorization=\"\", @fraud_review=nil, @error_code=nil, @emv_authorization=nil, @avs_result={\"code\"=>nil, \"message\"=>nil, \"street_match\"=>nil, \"postal_match\"=>nil}, @cvv_result={\"code\"=>nil, \"message\"=>nil}>\r\n",

The problem is the Authorize.net API returns `getTransactionListResponse` instead of the expected `getTransactionListForCustomerResponse`. I spoke with the Authorize.net developers and they are going to review this issue, but have concerns that they won't be able to change the response as too many services are already built around how it is now.\r\n\r\nI'm opening this issue with the expectations that they won't be able to make this change to the API meaning ActiveMerchant will have to account for this inconsistency.
