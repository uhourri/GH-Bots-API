                "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nThis adds an `entityPresentationApiRef` to the frontend, provided by the catalog, that lets you decide how to render entity refs in the Backstage user interface. This centralises whether to go by name, by title, by profile info, etc - even when extending the model with custom kinds. Its default implementation very efficiently batch fetches all required information from the catalog and caches it using a data loader, making the solution convenient and speedy, performing as few repaints as possible. The main consuming components are `EntityRefLink` and the new `EntityDisplayName` (which is the guts of the former, but without click behaviour).\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-20 at 22 46 06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3097461/233483905-6a0ab0ce-2e6e-4c0b-b760-3411725c6184.png)\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nAs discussed in [the catalog SIG](https://github.com/backstage/community/tree/main/sigs/sig-catalog), and asked for repeatedly through the life of the Backstage project, there is a need to consolidate how [entity refs](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/references) - pointers to entities and their names/titles - are rendered. Currently in the Backstage interface, most commonly we just render [the `metadata.name`](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/descriptor-format#name-required) field, sometimes prefixed with [kind](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/descriptor-format#apiversion-and-kind-required) and/or [namespace](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/descriptor-format#namespace-optional). And the reason for doing so, is that at the point in time of actually rendering the ref, that's all the data we are holding in memory. Entities contain other fields that might have been more useful to the end user to display - for example a [title](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/descriptor-format#title-optional) or the [display name](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/descriptor-format#specprofile-optional-1) of a user's or group's profile info. And there is more information that could be interesting to glean as part of an entity reference, such as the [more granular type](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/descriptor-format#spectype-required) of entity that it is, etc. But getting that data for display means a round trip to the catalog, and if every component did that fetch on its own it would severely delay rendering of the user interface and lead to lots of reinvention of the same code paths.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nThe default implementation of the API is basically [a Dataloader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader) with a backing store that expires items after some time, and a never-expiring in-memory cache that can be used for instant paints of whatever information we have at hand while we refresh it in the background. The first time a ref link is rendered and no additional entity data is present, it'll paint a nice fallback based on only the ref itself while the framework streams in catalog data in the background. When it arrives, the presentation is reconsidered and a new paint may happen. The next time around, the entity will already be cached in memory and we can instantly render with the right representation. If enough time has passed since last time, the presentation API checks in the background whether the entity has changed since last time around and whether another paint is needed with the new information.\r\n\r\nAll fetching is memoized and batched, and only grabs the absolute minimum of fields of each entity that it needs to decide on the presentation, and always in the background. This makes them fast and never blocking renders.\r\n\r\n## Future work\r\n\r\nThis API should be used everywhere where a reference to an entity is made. For example in the headers of pages, in nodes of entity graphs, etc etc. To help with that, an `EntityDisplayName` component was made which would be suitable e.g. in headers.\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\n- Using this API does mean that the Backstage interface will issue relatively frequent batch queries to the catalog, contributing to its load. However, the behavior can be disabled (replacing the implementation with one that doesn't call out to the catalog), and they are fairly lightweight since they only need partial data and only happen when client side caches are cold.\r\n- This API does not have real time information from the catalog; there is an inherent delay between changes getting saved in the catalog and the API fetching back those changes to be reflected in the interface. This can be mitigated by setting the cache TTL to effectively zero, but that also increases the load on the catalog somewhat.\r\n- The asynchronous fetching of data from the catalog means that repaints / relayouts sometimes happen in the interface, which can be disrupting. The placeholder that gets rendered while waiting for the data will probably not be shaped the same as the end state. After the cache gets hot, this generally becomes a non-issue since the next render will use the previously fetched entity to render a proper full presentation while double checking that it hasn't changed (which it extremely rarely has).\r\n\r\n## Considerations for the reviewer\r\n\r\nThe interfaces need careful consideration here. The backing implementation isn't particularly complex or interesting I think, but the presentation type definitely is.\r\n\r\nThe two extremes probably is to either\r\n\r\n- Expose only raw data, basically the plain entity and perhaps a single title-like string, or\r\n- Going extremely \"visual\" and returning `React.ReactNode` or even `JSX.Element`, allowing absolutely anything at all\r\n\r\nFor example, the current implementation has a primary and secondary title, plus an icon. And it also returns the ref and entity as auxiliary information. But already, the secondary title feels limiting. Ideally it should be possible to seamlessly insert the usage of something like [the entity peek-ahead popover](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/15014) transparently around links, without the caller having to know exactly how it's formed. So all that is open for discussion really.\r\n\r\nNote also that in the current design, renderers themselves can't be async. Ie you can't build a renderer that reaches out to an external system to get auxiliary data for the rendering. We could in theory make that possible, but we still need to retain the ability to instantly return results. I think it'd entail inverting control and putting more responsibility on the renderer itself, to make it work; it'd have to be the one that effectively \"drives\" the observable, rather than being called more than once. Or perhaps it could return an optional promise as part of its output, and the framework awaits that promise and sends its return value back to the renderer in the second call. Anyway, slight additional complexity, and could be added as a future feature without breaking interfaces, I think.",

We have a `CODEOWNERS` file in that repository and ideally we want to reduce manual actions and update that file with the team that has created a service.\r\nI'm looking for a workflow like this:\r\n```\r\n    - id: fetch_codeowners\r\n      name: Fetch CODEOWNERS from IaC\r\n      action: fetch:plain\r\n      input:\r\n        url: https://gitlab.com/.../-/blob/main/CODEOWNERS\r\n        targetPath: external/iac\r\n\r\n    - id: update_codeowners\r\n      name: Update CODEOWNERS\r\n      action: miro:update-codeowners\r\n      input:\r\n        path: external/iac/CODEOWNERS\r\n```\n\n### \u270c\ufe0f Possible Implementation\n\n_No response_\n\n### \ud83d\udc40 Have you spent some time to check if this feature request has been raised before?\n\n- [X] I checked and didn't find similar issue\n\n### \ud83c\udfe2 Have you read the Code of Conduct?\n\n- [X] I have read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\nNo, but I'm happy to collaborate on a PR with someone else",

When passed a string the `Typography` component used is `p`, for anything else we use `span`. The spacing between the component's label's `p` and content is different depending on if it is a `span` or another `p`.\r\nIn practice, any links passed into this component will have more spacing between the label and content. This is fine when the component is used elsewhere, and where that spacing is consistent. But when used in the header, and when right next to non-link sibling components, the spacing difference is obvious. \r\n\r\nBy specifying that we want to use a `p` tag in this specific use for owner links inside `EntityLayout`, we can have the link and non-link items in the header have consistent spacing. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe what you added, and add a screenshot if possible.\r\n     That makes it easier to understand the change so we can :shipit: faster. -->\r\n### Changes\r\n- add optional prop to `HeaderLabel` that sets `Typography` `component` prop\r\n- use new prop in `EntityLayout`\r\n- add tests\r\n\r\n### Before (note spacing between label and content)\r\n![SCR-20231023-l8s](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/assets/30599893/92ba7dcc-b8a6-499c-8a98-192e557ce126)\r\n\r\n### After\r\n![SCR-20231023-l8i](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/assets/30599893/fb163d01-e464-4212-a2c2-8e690ebf6313)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### :heavy_check_mark: Checklist\r\n\r\n<!--- Please include the following in your Pull Request when applicable: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] A changeset describing the change and affected packages.

When passed a string the `Typography` component used is `p`, for anything else we use `span`. The spacing between the component's label's `p` and content is different depending on if it is a `span` or another `p`.\r\nIn practice, any links passed into this component will have more spacing between the label and content. This is fine when the component is used elsewhere, and where that spacing is consistent. But when used in the header, and when right next to non-link sibling components, the spacing difference is obvious. \r\n\r\nBy specifying that we want to use a `p` tag in this specific use for owner links inside `EntityLayout`, we can have the link and non-link items in the header have consistent spacing. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe what you added, and add a screenshot if possible.\r\n     That makes it easier to understand the change so we can :shipit: faster. -->\r\n### Changes\r\n- add optional prop to `HeaderLabel` that sets `Typography` `component` prop\r\n- use new prop in `EntityLayout`\r\n- add tests\r\n\r\n### Before (note spacing between label and content)\r\n![SCR-20231023-l8s](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/assets/30599893/92ba7dcc-b8a6-499c-8a98-192e557ce126)\r\n\r\n### After\r\n![SCR-20231023-l8i](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/assets/30599893/fb163d01-e464-4212-a2c2-8e690ebf6313)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### :heavy_check_mark: Checklist\r\n\r\n<!--- Please include the following in your Pull Request when applicable: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] A changeset describing the change and affected packages.

When passed a string the `Typography` component used is `p`, for anything else we use `span`. The spacing between the component's label's `p` and content is different depending on if it is a `span` or another `p`.\r\nIn practice, any links passed into this component will have more spacing between the label and content. This is fine when the component is used elsewhere, and where that spacing is consistent. But when used in the header, and when right next to non-link sibling components, the spacing difference is obvious. \r\n\r\nBy specifying that we want to use a `p` tag in this specific use for owner links inside `EntityLayout`, we can have the link and non-link items in the header have consistent spacing. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe what you added, and add a screenshot if possible.\r\n     That makes it easier to understand the change so we can :shipit: faster. -->\r\n### Changes\r\n- add optional prop to `HeaderLabel` that sets `Typography` `component` prop\r\n- use new prop in `EntityLayout`\r\n- add tests\r\n\r\n### Before (note spacing between label and content)\r\n![SCR-20231023-l8s](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/assets/30599893/92ba7dcc-b8a6-499c-8a98-192e557ce126)\r\n\r\n### After\r\n![SCR-20231023-l8i](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/assets/30599893/fb163d01-e464-4212-a2c2-8e690ebf6313)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### :heavy_check_mark: Checklist\r\n\r\n<!--- Please include the following in your Pull Request when applicable: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] A changeset describing the change and affected packages.

When passed a string the `Typography` component used is `p`, for anything else we use `span`. The spacing between the component's label's `p` and content is different depending on if it is a `span` or another `p`.\r\nIn practice, any links passed into this component will have more spacing between the label and content. This is fine when the component is used elsewhere, and where that spacing is consistent. But when used in the header, and when right next to non-link sibling components, the spacing difference is obvious. \r\n\r\nBy specifying that we want to use a `p` tag in this specific use for owner links inside `EntityLayout`, we can have the link and non-link items in the header have consistent spacing. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe what you added, and add a screenshot if possible.\r\n     That makes it easier to understand the change so we can :shipit: faster. -->\r\n### Changes\r\n- add optional prop to `HeaderLabel` that sets `Typography` `component` prop\r\n- use new prop in `EntityLayout`\r\n- add tests\r\n\r\n### Before (note spacing between label and content)\r\n![SCR-20231023-l8s](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/assets/30599893/92ba7dcc-b8a6-499c-8a98-192e557ce126)\r\n\r\n### After\r\n![SCR-20231023-l8i](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/assets/30599893/fb163d01-e464-4212-a2c2-8e690ebf6313)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### :heavy_check_mark: Checklist\r\n\r\n<!--- Please include the following in your Pull Request when applicable: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] A changeset describing the change and affected packages.

When passed a string the `Typography` component used is `p`, for anything else we use `span`. The spacing between the component's label's `p` and content is different depending on if it is a `span` or another `p`.\r\nIn practice, any links passed into this component will have more spacing between the label and content. This is fine when the component is used elsewhere, and where that spacing is consistent. But when used in the header, and when right next to non-link sibling components, the spacing difference is obvious. \r\n\r\nBy specifying that we want to use a `p` tag in this specific use for owner links inside `EntityLayout`, we can have the link and non-link items in the header have consistent spacing. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe what you added, and add a screenshot if possible.\r\n     That makes it easier to understand the change so we can :shipit: faster. -->\r\n### Changes\r\n- add optional prop to `HeaderLabel` that sets `Typography` `component` prop\r\n- use new prop in `EntityLayout`\r\n- add tests\r\n\r\n### Before (note spacing between label and content)\r\n![SCR-20231023-l8s](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/assets/30599893/92ba7dcc-b8a6-499c-8a98-192e557ce126)\r\n\r\n### After\r\n![SCR-20231023-l8i](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/assets/30599893/fb163d01-e464-4212-a2c2-8e690ebf6313)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### :heavy_check_mark: Checklist\r\n\r\n<!--- Please include the following in your Pull Request when applicable: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] A changeset describing the change and affected packages.
