It's very easy to make the warning go away *if* you have development tools installed and you know what to do, but despite our attempts to document this in glmmTMB (e.g. [here](https://github.com/glmmTMB/glmmTMB/issues/886#issuecomment-1461074619), [here](https://glmmtmb.github.io/glmmTMB/#glmmtmbtmbmatrix-mismatches)), it continues to be a source of concern and confusion for end-users. When this comes up on the r-devel list, we've tried to suggest that there be a way to ask CRAN to re-build binary packages when a new version of a lower-level package (Matrix > TMB > glmmTMB) is posted, but we haven't had much response. The other alternative is to make sure that we bump the versions ourselves and re-post to CRAN as necessary, but so far this also seems to be a source of friction (i.e. in order to do this we have to at least make sure that we are up to date on all CRAN checks, run tests on `r-hub` etc., check downstream packages for breakage ...)\r\n\r\nWe could try to reduce developer friction, e.g. by  making  it easier for ourselves to push new `glmmTMB` versions (e.g. we could maintain a tag/branch with the HEAD equal to the last CRAN submission, or even keep the last-submitted tarball around, so that we could resubmit it without doing any more checks).\r\n\r\nHowever, it would be really useful to me at least to understand the **exact** reason why this incompatibility arises, to be able to do a better job explaining and resolving the issue ...\r\n\r\nIf this is more suited for the `glmmTMB` issues list, or the TMB mailing list, please let me know.\r\n\r\n",

It's very easy to make the warning go away *if* you have development tools installed and you know what to do, but despite our attempts to document this in glmmTMB (e.g. [here](https://github.com/glmmTMB/glmmTMB/issues/886#issuecomment-1461074619), [here](https://glmmtmb.github.io/glmmTMB/#glmmtmbtmbmatrix-mismatches)), it continues to be a source of concern and confusion for end-users. When this comes up on the r-devel list, we've tried to suggest that there be a way to ask CRAN to re-build binary packages when a new version of a lower-level package (Matrix > TMB > glmmTMB) is posted, but we haven't had much response. The other alternative is to make sure that we bump the versions ourselves and re-post to CRAN as necessary, but so far this also seems to be a source of friction (i.e. in order to do this we have to at least make sure that we are up to date on all CRAN checks, run tests on `r-hub` etc., check downstream packages for breakage ...)\r\n\r\nWe could try to reduce developer friction, e.g. by  making  it easier for ourselves to push new `glmmTMB` versions (e.g. we could maintain a tag/branch with the HEAD equal to the last CRAN submission, or even keep the last-submitted tarball around, so that we could resubmit it without doing any more checks).\r\n\r\nHowever, it would be really useful to me at least to understand the **exact** reason why this incompatibility arises, to be able to do a better job explaining and resolving the issue ...\r\n\r\nIf this is more suited for the `glmmTMB` issues list, or the TMB mailing list, please let me know.\r\n\r\n",

Where possible, packages should start to\r\n      use \\code{LinkingTo: Matrix (>= 1.6-2)} and include files from the\r\n      new subdirectory, e.g., with \\code{#include <Matrix/Matrix.h>}.\r\n\r\n      \\item Users including API headers can define macro\r\n      \\code{R_MATRIX_INLINE},\r\n      typically with \\code{#define R_MATRIX_INLINE inline},\r\n      to allow the compiler to inline stubs for registered routines.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, indeed, 1.6-2 breaks a long run of **Matrix** releases without ABI changes.  But that does _not_ imply that **TMB** should continue to warn about version mismatch by default.\r\n\r\nWhen we release new versions of **Matrix**, it is _our_ responsibility to notify the CRAN team about ABI changes and to ask for rev. dep. binaries to be rebuilt.  And we will do that when we submit 1.6-2.\r\n\r\nBut rebuilds do not affect package versions: currently, users must \"know\" to use `install.packages` and not `update.packages`.  That is not a reasonable expectation, so it _also_ our responsibility to test for breakage attributable to the ABI (by installing rev. dep. under **Matrix**-release and checking them under **Matrix**-devel) and to ask \"broken\" packages to submit an update coinciding with the next **Matrix** release.\r\n\r\nThe updates serve only to ensure that `update.packages` installs compatible builds, so they should be minimal, typically only changing the `Date` and `Version` fields in `DESCRIPTION` and ideally also changing to `LinkingTo: Matrix (>= x.y-z)`, if x.y-z is the new version.  Such updates do _not_ require extensive rev. dep. checking.\r\n\r\nThis whole situation should be considered exceptional, happening only if we update SuiteSparse or discover bugs.  For as long as I am/have been a co-author, we do not change the ABI without determining and consulting affected rev. dep. maintainers.  (And had I not seen this thread I'd have notified you about the 1.6-2 changes.  Well, you might still receive an e-mail.)\r\n\r\nI am really not convinced that **TMB** and others should continue defending against problems that arise only exceptionally and which should be handled as much as possible by the maintainers introducing ABI changes (by asking CRAN for rebuilds, rev. dep. maintainers for version bumps) and as little as possible by end users.",

It's very easy to make the warning go away *if* you have development tools installed and you know what to do, but despite our attempts to document this in glmmTMB (e.g. [here](https://github.com/glmmTMB/glmmTMB/issues/886#issuecomment-1461074619), [here](https://glmmtmb.github.io/glmmTMB/#glmmtmbtmbmatrix-mismatches)), it continues to be a source of concern and confusion for end-users. When this comes up on the r-devel list, we've tried to suggest that there be a way to ask CRAN to re-build binary packages when a new version of a lower-level package (Matrix > TMB > glmmTMB) is posted, but we haven't had much response. The other alternative is to make sure that we bump the versions ourselves and re-post to CRAN as necessary, but so far this also seems to be a source of friction (i.e. in order to do this we have to at least make sure that we are up to date on all CRAN checks, run tests on `r-hub` etc., check downstream packages for breakage ...)\r\n\r\nWe could try to reduce developer friction, e.g. by  making  it easier for ourselves to push new `glmmTMB` versions (e.g. we could maintain a tag/branch with the HEAD equal to the last CRAN submission, or even keep the last-submitted tarball around, so that we could resubmit it without doing any more checks).\r\n\r\nHowever, it would be really useful to me at least to understand the **exact** reason why this incompatibility arises, to be able to do a better job explaining and resolving the issue ...\r\n\r\nIf this is more suited for the `glmmTMB` issues list, or the TMB mailing list, please let me know.\r\n\r\n",

Perhaps it has been renamed... In any case, the API `AS_CHM_SP(x)` hasn't changed.

After that, everything would fail, even `TMB::runExample(\"simple\")`.\r\n\r\nGood news is that the problem is hard to reproduce today. If I install TMB using `Matrix 1.6-1`, I can switch to any other Matrix version without breaking TMB! (I tested down to `Matrix 1.2-3` from 2015-11-19, the earliest I can install).\r\n\r\nBased on this, I think the version test isn't justified anymore and can be omitted by default.\r\n",

It's very easy to make the warning go away *if* you have development tools installed and you know what to do, but despite our attempts to document this in glmmTMB (e.g. [here](https://github.com/glmmTMB/glmmTMB/issues/886#issuecomment-1461074619), [here](https://glmmtmb.github.io/glmmTMB/#glmmtmbtmbmatrix-mismatches)), it continues to be a source of concern and confusion for end-users. When this comes up on the r-devel list, we've tried to suggest that there be a way to ask CRAN to re-build binary packages when a new version of a lower-level package (Matrix > TMB > glmmTMB) is posted, but we haven't had much response. The other alternative is to make sure that we bump the versions ourselves and re-post to CRAN as necessary, but so far this also seems to be a source of friction (i.e. in order to do this we have to at least make sure that we are up to date on all CRAN checks, run tests on `r-hub` etc., check downstream packages for breakage ...)\r\n\r\nWe could try to reduce developer friction, e.g. by  making  it easier for ourselves to push new `glmmTMB` versions (e.g. we could maintain a tag/branch with the HEAD equal to the last CRAN submission, or even keep the last-submitted tarball around, so that we could resubmit it without doing any more checks).\r\n\r\nHowever, it would be really useful to me at least to understand the **exact** reason why this incompatibility arises, to be able to do a better job explaining and resolving the issue ...\r\n\r\nIf this is more suited for the `glmmTMB` issues list, or the TMB mailing list, please let me know.\r\n\r\n",
