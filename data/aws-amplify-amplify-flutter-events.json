                "body": "Greetings! I am working on Cashflow, a fintech app built with Flutter and AWS Amplify. It enables collection agents to create customers, manage loan transactions, and collect EMI payments from borrowers in their assigned areas.\r\n\r\n> The issue at hand specifically arises in release mode on Android, and the device remains consistently connected to the network.\r\n\r\nOnce the release APK is installed, all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations performed should automatically sync data to the cloud. However, if the app is left unused for an extended period or resumes from a detached lifecycle state, syncing issues may occur. For instance, if the app is swiped away, the phone is turned off and on again, and the app is reopened, the data gets stuck in the \"Outbox Mutation Enqueued\" state, failing to sync with the cloud. To sync local mutations to the cloud, a restart of the app is always required\r\n\r\nI've attempted various solutions, such as stopping and restarting the Amplify DataStore and reinitializing the plugin at runtime, but the issue persists.\r\n\r\n### Upon my careful observation, I have come to the conclusion that my issue is related to the utilization of a GraphQL schema. Every time data syncing halts just before the \"Outbox Mutation Processed\" state, It indicates the problem arises when the datastore is interacting with the GraphQL API  for data synchronization (resulting in a cessation of cloud syncing due to GraphQL API issues). ###\r\n\r\n### I noticed that if my mobile device is disconnected from the network, any new customers I create, let's say A and B, are saved locally. When I'm connected to the network again, if there's an error with the GraphQL API, the data for customers A and B doesn't sync with the cloud (I used the DataStore errorHandler parameter to detect errors, but I did not receive any errors from the errorHandler function. Each time, the data stops at outboxMutationEnqueuedEvent). Although I didn't receive any plugin errors, Later, I created two more customers, C and D, and their data is also saved locally. However, after restarting the app, only customers A and B's data is synced, but not customers C and D's (which means that the data created before the plug-in error is retained and synced to the cloud, but the data created after the plug-in error is only retained locally and isn't synced to the cloud) If I reinstall the app, I lose the data for customers C and D. ###\r\n\r\nI would greatly appreciate any recommendations or specific steps to address this issue. If you have encountered a similar challenge or have insights that could guide me, please feel free to share. Any additional information you believe would be helpful in resolving this issue is more than welcome.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance in advance! Your guidance is highly valued.",
