I was wondering what could be causing this problem.\r\n\r\nA typical programming error is to fail to close an open file. Usually it is caused by someone adding new code that fails to account for the need to close the file. Or it is due to an alternative code path that was not covered by testing.\r\n\r\nI wonder if this problem is new to macOS Sonoma.\r\n\r\nNow that the root cause has been identified I am going to go ahead and close this issue. If you do find that there is a problem with how IINA handles this, please feel free to reopen this issue or open a new one.",

Use assrt as source of subtitles\r\n2. Choose a subtitle resource with more than 2 subtitles (which means there are more than 2 subtitles in the `filelist`, usually this happens when the resource contains subtitles for the whole season, rather than one episode)\r\n3. It should pop up a hint to display the download task is failed.\r\n\r\n**Cause analysis:**\r\n\r\nAfter validating the API and server ability of assrt, this issue is in the IINA side. When use proxy tools such as Proxyman, it's easy to guess the assrt server limits the concurrency requests.\r\n\r\n**How often does this happen?**\r\n\r\nQuite often\r\n",

                "body": "Hello from a junior IINA developer. Thank you for reporting this and especially for posting a pull request with a fix.\r\n\r\nOn this:\r\n> Maybe we could provide a window selector for users to pick files they want to download.\r\n\r\nThat is what `SubChooseViewController` is supposed to do? I'm only familiar with the code for [Open Subtitles](https://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/subs). In `OpenSub` a `Subtitle` instance is associated with one subtitle file. In `Assrt` the `Subtitle` class contains a `fileList` property.  I know nothing about  this site's API so I'm not understanding why there are multiple files. Maybe the same subtitles are available in different file formats?\r\n\r\nIn any case at this time a more important consideration is this code:\r\nhttps://github.com/iina/iina/blob/aa5a4158cef44e972c8515c2a723db14bc97bd83/iina/OnlineSubtitle.swift#L102-L105\r\n\r\nThe built-in online subtitle provider code is now considered [legacy code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_code). This is because the plan is to switch to plug-ins for such implementation. The plug-in system is included in the current release of IINA, but is disabled as it is not quite ready to be officially released. The plan is to enable it in the upcoming feature release.\r\n\r\nGiven that, enhancements such as adding a window selector probably should be done as a part of the plug-in conversion.\r\n\r\nOpen Subtitles is shutting down their XMLRPC API at the end of 2023. I am currently finishing changing the current Open Subtitles legacy code to switch to their new REST API. This is a temporary stopgap solution that may end up going straight into the trash if a plugin implementation can be created in time to meet the deadline.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking IINA should not rush the feature release. Given the limited time left in the year I plan on proposing that IINA release a maintenance release before starting to work on the feature release. I will add PR #4672 to the fixes that should be included in this release. Of course it will be up to the senior developers as to what plans are appropriate to adopt.",
