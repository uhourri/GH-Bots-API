                "body": "The README example shows how `with.path` is meant to be specified - as a multi-line YAML string:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- uses: actions/cache@v2\r\n  with:\r\n    path: |\r\n      ~/cache\r\n      !~/cache/exclude\r\n      **/node_modules\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis correlates with what we can see in the code: https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/354332455a7a9ae5492723ca9d4d082484e173bc/src/utils/actionUtils.ts#L56-L65\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this format is rather unfriendly to humans. It does not allow inline comments, for example, which would be really useful to document *why* certain paths are being cached. Worse even, attempting to use YAML-like comments results in silently broken caching; see https://github.com/mvdan/github-actions-golang/pull/16.\r\n\r\nI assume this is rooted at how action inputs are strings. At an internal level, that makes sense. However, at the user-facing YAML level, I think this action should take a YAML list, not a list-encoded-in-newline-separated-strings multiline string. Internally, the Actions software could turn the YAML list into the newline-separated string, and that could be entirely transparent to the user:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- uses: actions/cache@v2\r\n  with:\r\n    path:\r\n    - ~/cache\r\n    - !~/cache/exclude # some comment\r\n    - **/node_modules  # some other comment\r\n```\r\n\r\nI realise this is probably an issue that cannot be fixed in this repository alone, but I still think it belongs in this repository as it is a very clear example that's making actions/cache harder to use properly. I'm completely fine with this issue being moved elsewhere, but please don't close it as \"not a bug in this repository\" :)",

Our plan is to transition all actions to run on Node 20 by Spring 2024. We will actively monitor the migration's progress and gather community feedback before finalizing the transition date. Starting October 23rd, workflows containing actions running on Node 16 will display a warning to alert users about the upcoming migration.\r\n> ## What you need to do\r\n> ### For Actions maintainers\r\n> Modify your actions to run on Node 20 instead of Node 16. For guidance, refer to the [Actions configuration settings ](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#runs-for-javascript-actions).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote: also applies to nested `restore` action.

(you might have intended to write something different than echoing my description... or you're a bot, in which case... _**beep beep, boop**_ )\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, I think I found the problem that was causing the cache miss, which I'm also a little confused at:\r\n```yaml\r\n      - name: Upload snapshot artifacts\r\n        uses: actions/cache/save@704facf57e6136b1bc63b828d79edcd491f0ee84 #v3.3.2\r\n        with:\r\n          path: |\r\n            snapshot\r\n            .task\r\n          key: snapshot-build-${{ github.run_id }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nfollowed by:\r\n```yaml\r\n      - name: Download snapshot build\r\n        id: snapshot-cache\r\n        uses: actions/cache/restore@704facf57e6136b1bc63b828d79edcd491f0ee84 #v3.3.2\r\n        with:\r\n          path: snapshot\r\n          fail-on-cache-miss: true\r\n          key: snapshot-build-${{ github.run_id }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the difference in the `path` provided (`snapshot` vs `[snapshot, .task]` logically).\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that I'd be able to store multiple paths and restore one of those paths, which does not appear to be working. However, in my case, this was a bug and I should have been restoring both paths anyway.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, it still doesn't address the original problem (`fail-on-cache-miss` doesn't fail the workflow) so I have the following workaround for now as a subsequent step:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n      - name: (cache-miss) Snapshot build missing\r\n        if: steps.snapshot-cache.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'\r\n        run: echo \"unable to download snapshots from previous job\" && false\r\n```",

Rust has a notoriously slow compiler, and we expect many users have the same problem.\r\n\r\nRust's compiler has a feature to help in this situation: incremental builds. `actions/cache` does not directly support having each job start with the build directory produced by the previous successful build. But Rust's compiler can save a significant amount of work if you do things this way. In each build, it only has to compile the code that has actually changed.\r\n\r\nWith a typical `actions/cache` configuration, Rust ends up doing more and more work with each push, as the changes between the cached build and the current build accumulate. With the example added in this PR, the cached build will be the latest. Incremental builds will then kick in automatically (you don't have to pass any special flags to `cargo`).\r\n\r\nThe only downside is that this produces more cache entries. It creates a new cache entry after _every_ successful run, not just when the cache is invalidated. I don't know if that's likely to make problems for anyone. If so, let's talk about it.\r\n\r\nAdding `rust-toolchain.toml` is an independent, minor change. If your project has that file, it selects which version of the Rust compiler you're using and which components of Rust to install. When you change versions, Rust will recompile all your code anyway, so there's little point using the cache.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nWe've been using this technique in @github/blackbird for months now.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] Documentation (add or update README or docs)\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [x] My code follows the code style of this project.\r\n- [x] My change requires a change to the documentation.\r\n- [x] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n- [x] I have read the **CONTRIBUTING** document.\r\n- [ ] I have added tests to cover my changes. - *I don't think there are tests for the examples file.*\r\n- [ ] All new and existing tests passed.\r\n",

Rust has a notoriously slow compiler, and we expect many users have the same problem.\r\n\r\nRust's compiler has a feature to help in this situation: incremental builds. `actions/cache` does not directly support having each job start with the build directory produced by the previous successful build. But Rust's compiler can save a significant amount of work if you do things this way. In each build, it only has to compile the code that has actually changed.\r\n\r\nWith a typical `actions/cache` configuration, Rust ends up doing more and more work with each push, as the changes between the cached build and the current build accumulate. With the example added in this PR, the cached build will be the latest. Incremental builds will then kick in automatically (you don't have to pass any special flags to `cargo`).\r\n\r\nThe only downside is that this produces more cache entries. It creates a new cache entry after _every_ successful run, not just when the cache is invalidated. I don't know if that's likely to make problems for anyone. If so, let's talk about it.\r\n\r\nAdding `rust-toolchain.toml` is an independent, minor change. If your project has that file, it selects which version of the Rust compiler you're using and which components of Rust to install. When you change versions, Rust will recompile all your code anyway, so there's little point using the cache.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nWe've been using this technique in @github/blackbird for months now.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] Documentation (add or update README or docs)\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [x] My code follows the code style of this project.\r\n- [x] My change requires a change to the documentation.\r\n- [x] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n- [x] I have read the **CONTRIBUTING** document.\r\n- [ ] I have added tests to cover my changes. - *I don't think there are tests for the examples file.*\r\n- [ ] All new and existing tests passed.\r\n",

When I run my first job (compile) it saves all the dependencies required to compile the code. When I generate javadoc during the third step (package) it downloads the javadoc plugin into the .m2 folder but does not save it because it found a cache, that was hit at the primary key. When I try to use the javadoc plugin during site generation it has to redownload it.\r\n\r\nSame thing for build results. When I generate test reports in the second step, it does not save then because it already hit the cache, that was created during the first step (compile).\r\n\r\nI have a workaround, where I enter the primary key of the job before as a restore-key and give it a new primary key but it is still annoying...\r\n\r\nThank you for reading my feature request.",
