This ensures current colour contrast issues which have been observed in both components have been addressed. Also, when the `email` prop is passed on `Portrait` a `Link` component is now rendered with a `mailto: href` allowing users to send emails to the specified email addressed when clicked. Support has also been added for the `text` prop, which is additional text which appears under the email link, this is typically used for phone numbers, but can also be any other relevant read only text. \r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-10-18 at 11 45 57](https://github.com/Sage/carbon/assets/114918852/b59fc869-5090-4531-9f7d-28ff96db61dc)\r\n\r\nA new `darkBackground` variant has been added to `Profile`. This was already present in `Portait` but has been amended to represent new DS designs. This will allow consumers to use `Profile` or `Portait` in Ui which has a dark background. \r\n\r\nFinally, the DS class all text on `Profile` to be optional, when previously in the component they were mandatory. To address this, conditional rendering has been implemented to determine if any text children are present, if true the `Profile` component will be rendered. If false, the `Portrait` component is rendered instead. However, additional guards have also been placed to make sure the `name` prop is passed if consumers do pass text children.\r\n\r\nCode complexity has also been greatly reduced, with both .style files for each component being simplified, with the removal of unnecessary functions, types and interfaces. Resulting in a much cleaner structure and reduction in complexity. Also, both `Portrait` subcomponents `portrait-initials` and `portrait-gravatar` have been removed, with the formers functionality replaced with just rendering a `div` with centred text, and the latters functionality being added to the `Portrait` component.\r\n\r\n### Current behaviour\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of the behaviour before this change.\r\n\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots.

Resulting in a fairly complex component for what is only essentially a rounded or square image or `<div>`.\r\n\r\nNow all gravatar functionality has been moved inside the component file, and the `initials` prop no longer renders an `<img>`, instead it renders a `div` with text centred. \r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Each PR should include the following -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Commits follow our style guide\r\n- [ ] Related issues linked in commit messages if required\r\n- [x] Screenshots are included in the PR if useful\r\n- [ ] All themes are supported if required\r\n- [x] Unit tests added or updated if required\r\n- [ ] Cypress automation tests added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Playwright automation tests added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Storybook added or updated if required\r\n- [ ] Translations added or updated (including creating or amending translation keys table in storybook) if required\r\n- [x] Typescript `d.ts` file added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Related docs have been updated if required\r\n\r\n#### QA\r\n\r\n- [ ] Tested in CodeSandbox/storybook\r\n- [ ] Add new Cypress test coverage if required\r\n- [ ] Carbon implementation matches Design System/designs\r\n- [ ] UI Tests GitHub check reviewed if required\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or links about the pull request here. -->\r\n\r\n### Testing instructions\r\n\r\n<!-- How can a reviewer test this PR? -->\r\n\r\nThe following CodeSandbox is an example of the broken behaviour.\r\nYou can see the new behaviour by looking at the version in the comment by `codesandbox[bot]`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Add CodeSandbox here -->\r\n",

This ensures current colour contrast issues which have been observed in both components have been addressed. Also, when the `email` prop is passed on `Portrait` a `Link` component is now rendered with a `mailto: href` allowing users to send emails to the specified email addressed when clicked. Support has also been added for the `text` prop, which is additional text which appears under the email link, this is typically used for phone numbers, but can also be any other relevant read only text. \r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-10-18 at 11 45 57](https://github.com/Sage/carbon/assets/114918852/b59fc869-5090-4531-9f7d-28ff96db61dc)\r\n\r\nA new `darkBackground` variant has been added to `Profile`. This was already present in `Portait` but has been amended to represent new DS designs. This will allow consumers to use `Profile` or `Portait` in Ui which has a dark background. \r\n\r\nFinally, the DS class all text on `Profile` to be optional, when previously in the component they were mandatory. To address this, conditional rendering has been implemented to determine if any text children are present, if true the `Profile` component will be rendered. If false, the `Portrait` component is rendered instead. However, additional guards have also been placed to make sure the `name` prop is passed if consumers do pass text children.\r\n\r\nCode complexity has also been greatly reduced, with both .style files for each component being simplified, with the removal of unnecessary functions, types and interfaces. Resulting in a much cleaner structure and reduction in complexity. Also, both `Portrait` subcomponents `portrait-initials` and `portrait-gravatar` have been removed, with the formers functionality replaced with just rendering a `div` with centred text, and the latters functionality being added to the `Portrait` component.\r\n\r\n### Current behaviour\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of the behaviour before this change.\r\n\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots.

Resulting in a fairly complex component for what is only essentially a rounded or square image or `<div>`.\r\n\r\nNow all gravatar functionality has been moved inside the component file, and the `initials` prop no longer renders an `<img>`, instead it renders a `div` with text centred. \r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Each PR should include the following -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Commits follow our style guide\r\n- [ ] Related issues linked in commit messages if required\r\n- [x] Screenshots are included in the PR if useful\r\n- [ ] All themes are supported if required\r\n- [x] Unit tests added or updated if required\r\n- [ ] Cypress automation tests added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Playwright automation tests added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Storybook added or updated if required\r\n- [ ] Translations added or updated (including creating or amending translation keys table in storybook) if required\r\n- [x] Typescript `d.ts` file added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Related docs have been updated if required\r\n\r\n#### QA\r\n\r\n- [ ] Tested in CodeSandbox/storybook\r\n- [ ] Add new Cypress test coverage if required\r\n- [ ] Carbon implementation matches Design System/designs\r\n- [ ] UI Tests GitHub check reviewed if required\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or links about the pull request here. -->\r\n\r\n### Testing instructions\r\n\r\n<!-- How can a reviewer test this PR? -->\r\n\r\nThe following CodeSandbox is an example of the broken behaviour.\r\nYou can see the new behaviour by looking at the version in the comment by `codesandbox[bot]`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Add CodeSandbox here -->\r\n",

This ensures current colour contrast issues which have been observed in both components have been addressed. Also, when the `email` prop is passed on `Portrait` a `Link` component is now rendered with a `mailto: href` allowing users to send emails to the specified email addressed when clicked. Support has also been added for the `text` prop, which is additional text which appears under the email link, this is typically used for phone numbers, but can also be any other relevant read only text. \r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-10-18 at 11 45 57](https://github.com/Sage/carbon/assets/114918852/b59fc869-5090-4531-9f7d-28ff96db61dc)\r\n\r\nA new `darkBackground` variant has been added to `Profile`. This was already present in `Portait` but has been amended to represent new DS designs. This will allow consumers to use `Profile` or `Portait` in Ui which has a dark background. \r\n\r\nFinally, the DS class all text on `Profile` to be optional, when previously in the component they were mandatory. To address this, conditional rendering has been implemented to determine if any text children are present, if true the `Profile` component will be rendered. If false, the `Portrait` component is rendered instead. However, additional guards have also been placed to make sure the `name` prop is passed if consumers do pass text children.\r\n\r\nCode complexity has also been greatly reduced, with both .style files for each component being simplified, with the removal of unnecessary functions, types and interfaces. Resulting in a much cleaner structure and reduction in complexity. Also, both `Portrait` subcomponents `portrait-initials` and `portrait-gravatar` have been removed, with the formers functionality replaced with just rendering a `div` with centred text, and the latters functionality being added to the `Portrait` component.\r\n\r\n### Current behaviour\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of the behaviour before this change.\r\n\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots.

Resulting in a fairly complex component for what is only essentially a rounded or square image or `<div>`.\r\n\r\nNow all gravatar functionality has been moved inside the component file, and the `initials` prop no longer renders an `<img>`, instead it renders a `div` with text centred. \r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Each PR should include the following -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Commits follow our style guide\r\n- [ ] Related issues linked in commit messages if required\r\n- [x] Screenshots are included in the PR if useful\r\n- [ ] All themes are supported if required\r\n- [x] Unit tests added or updated if required\r\n- [ ] Cypress automation tests added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Playwright automation tests added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Storybook added or updated if required\r\n- [ ] Translations added or updated (including creating or amending translation keys table in storybook) if required\r\n- [x] Typescript `d.ts` file added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Related docs have been updated if required\r\n\r\n#### QA\r\n\r\n- [ ] Tested in CodeSandbox/storybook\r\n- [ ] Add new Cypress test coverage if required\r\n- [ ] Carbon implementation matches Design System/designs\r\n- [ ] UI Tests GitHub check reviewed if required\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or links about the pull request here. -->\r\n\r\n### Testing instructions\r\n\r\n<!-- How can a reviewer test this PR? -->\r\n\r\nThe following CodeSandbox is an example of the broken behaviour.\r\nYou can see the new behaviour by looking at the version in the comment by `codesandbox[bot]`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Add CodeSandbox here -->\r\n",

This ensures current colour contrast issues which have been observed in both components have been addressed. Also, when the `email` prop is passed on `Portrait` a `Link` component is now rendered with a `mailto: href` allowing users to send emails to the specified email addressed when clicked. Support has also been added for the `text` prop, which is additional text which appears under the email link, this is typically used for phone numbers, but can also be any other relevant read only text. \r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-10-18 at 11 45 57](https://github.com/Sage/carbon/assets/114918852/b59fc869-5090-4531-9f7d-28ff96db61dc)\r\n\r\nA new `darkBackground` variant has been added to `Profile`. This was already present in `Portait` but has been amended to represent new DS designs. This will allow consumers to use `Profile` or `Portait` in Ui which has a dark background. \r\n\r\nFinally, the DS class all text on `Profile` to be optional, when previously in the component they were mandatory. To address this, conditional rendering has been implemented to determine if any text children are present, if true the `Profile` component will be rendered. If false, the `Portrait` component is rendered instead. However, additional guards have also been placed to make sure the `name` prop is passed if consumers do pass text children.\r\n\r\nCode complexity has also been greatly reduced, with both .style files for each component being simplified, with the removal of unnecessary functions, types and interfaces. Resulting in a much cleaner structure and reduction in complexity. Also, both `Portrait` subcomponents `portrait-initials` and `portrait-gravatar` have been removed, with the formers functionality replaced with just rendering a `div` with centred text, and the latters functionality being added to the `Portrait` component.\r\n\r\n### Current behaviour\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of the behaviour before this change.\r\n\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots.

Resulting in a fairly complex component for what is only essentially a rounded or square image or `<div>`.\r\n\r\nNow all gravatar functionality has been moved inside the component file, and the `initials` prop no longer renders an `<img>`, instead it renders a `div` with text centred. \r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Each PR should include the following -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Commits follow our style guide\r\n- [ ] Related issues linked in commit messages if required\r\n- [x] Screenshots are included in the PR if useful\r\n- [ ] All themes are supported if required\r\n- [x] Unit tests added or updated if required\r\n- [ ] Cypress automation tests added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Playwright automation tests added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Storybook added or updated if required\r\n- [ ] Translations added or updated (including creating or amending translation keys table in storybook) if required\r\n- [x] Typescript `d.ts` file added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Related docs have been updated if required\r\n\r\n#### QA\r\n\r\n- [ ] Tested in CodeSandbox/storybook\r\n- [ ] Add new Cypress test coverage if required\r\n- [ ] Carbon implementation matches Design System/designs\r\n- [ ] UI Tests GitHub check reviewed if required\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or links about the pull request here. -->\r\n\r\n### Testing instructions\r\n\r\n<!-- How can a reviewer test this PR? -->\r\n\r\nThe following CodeSandbox is an example of the broken behaviour.\r\nYou can see the new behaviour by looking at the version in the comment by `codesandbox[bot]`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Add CodeSandbox here -->\r\n",

This ensures current colour contrast issues which have been observed in both components have been addressed. Also, when the `email` prop is passed on `Portrait` a `Link` component is now rendered with a `mailto: href` allowing users to send emails to the specified email addressed when clicked. Support has also been added for the `text` prop, which is additional text which appears under the email link, this is typically used for phone numbers, but can also be any other relevant read only text. \r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-10-18 at 11 45 57](https://github.com/Sage/carbon/assets/114918852/b59fc869-5090-4531-9f7d-28ff96db61dc)\r\n\r\nA new `darkBackground` variant has been added to `Profile`. This was already present in `Portait` but has been amended to represent new DS designs. This will allow consumers to use `Profile` or `Portait` in Ui which has a dark background. \r\n\r\nFinally, the DS class all text on `Profile` to be optional, when previously in the component they were mandatory. To address this, conditional rendering has been implemented to determine if any text children are present, if true the `Profile` component will be rendered. If false, the `Portrait` component is rendered instead. However, additional guards have also been placed to make sure the `name` prop is passed if consumers do pass text children.\r\n\r\nCode complexity has also been greatly reduced, with both .style files for each component being simplified, with the removal of unnecessary functions, types and interfaces. Resulting in a much cleaner structure and reduction in complexity. Also, both `Portrait` subcomponents `portrait-initials` and `portrait-gravatar` have been removed, with the formers functionality replaced with just rendering a `div` with centred text, and the latters functionality being added to the `Portrait` component.\r\n\r\n### Current behaviour\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of the behaviour before this change.\r\n\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots.

Resulting in a fairly complex component for what is only essentially a rounded or square image or `<div>`.\r\n\r\nNow all gravatar functionality has been moved inside the component file, and the `initials` prop no longer renders an `<img>`, instead it renders a `div` with text centred. \r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Each PR should include the following -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Commits follow our style guide\r\n- [ ] Related issues linked in commit messages if required\r\n- [x] Screenshots are included in the PR if useful\r\n- [ ] All themes are supported if required\r\n- [x] Unit tests added or updated if required\r\n- [ ] Cypress automation tests added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Playwright automation tests added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Storybook added or updated if required\r\n- [ ] Translations added or updated (including creating or amending translation keys table in storybook) if required\r\n- [x] Typescript `d.ts` file added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Related docs have been updated if required\r\n\r\n#### QA\r\n\r\n- [ ] Tested in CodeSandbox/storybook\r\n- [ ] Add new Cypress test coverage if required\r\n- [ ] Carbon implementation matches Design System/designs\r\n- [ ] UI Tests GitHub check reviewed if required\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or links about the pull request here. -->\r\n\r\n### Testing instructions\r\n\r\n<!-- How can a reviewer test this PR? -->\r\n\r\nThe following CodeSandbox is an example of the broken behaviour.\r\nYou can see the new behaviour by looking at the version in the comment by `codesandbox[bot]`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Add CodeSandbox here -->\r\n",

This ensures current colour contrast issues which have been observed in both components have been addressed. Also, when the `email` prop is passed on `Portrait` a `Link` component is now rendered with a `mailto: href` allowing users to send emails to the specified email addressed when clicked. Support has also been added for the `text` prop, which is additional text which appears under the email link, this is typically used for phone numbers, but can also be any other relevant read only text. \r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-10-18 at 11 45 57](https://github.com/Sage/carbon/assets/114918852/b59fc869-5090-4531-9f7d-28ff96db61dc)\r\n\r\nA new `darkBackground` variant has been added to `Profile`. This was already present in `Portait` but has been amended to represent new DS designs. This will allow consumers to use `Profile` or `Portait` in Ui which has a dark background. \r\n\r\nFinally, the DS class all text on `Profile` to be optional, when previously in the component they were mandatory. To address this, conditional rendering has been implemented to determine if any text children are present, if true the `Profile` component will be rendered. If false, the `Portrait` component is rendered instead. However, additional guards have also been placed to make sure the `name` prop is passed if consumers do pass text children.\r\n\r\nCode complexity has also been greatly reduced, with both .style files for each component being simplified, with the removal of unnecessary functions, types and interfaces. Resulting in a much cleaner structure and reduction in complexity. Also, both `Portrait` subcomponents `portrait-initials` and `portrait-gravatar` have been removed, with the formers functionality replaced with just rendering a `div` with centred text, and the latters functionality being added to the `Portrait` component.\r\n\r\n### Current behaviour\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of the behaviour before this change.\r\n\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots.

Resulting in a fairly complex component for what is only essentially a rounded or square image or `<div>`.\r\n\r\nNow all gravatar functionality has been moved inside the component file, and the `initials` prop no longer renders an `<img>`, instead it renders a `div` with text centred. \r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Each PR should include the following -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Commits follow our style guide\r\n- [ ] Related issues linked in commit messages if required\r\n- [x] Screenshots are included in the PR if useful\r\n- [ ] All themes are supported if required\r\n- [x] Unit tests added or updated if required\r\n- [ ] Cypress automation tests added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Playwright automation tests added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Storybook added or updated if required\r\n- [ ] Translations added or updated (including creating or amending translation keys table in storybook) if required\r\n- [x] Typescript `d.ts` file added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Related docs have been updated if required\r\n\r\n#### QA\r\n\r\n- [ ] Tested in CodeSandbox/storybook\r\n- [ ] Add new Cypress test coverage if required\r\n- [ ] Carbon implementation matches Design System/designs\r\n- [ ] UI Tests GitHub check reviewed if required\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or links about the pull request here. -->\r\n\r\n### Testing instructions\r\n\r\n<!-- How can a reviewer test this PR? -->\r\n\r\nThe following CodeSandbox is an example of the broken behaviour.\r\nYou can see the new behaviour by looking at the version in the comment by `codesandbox[bot]`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Add CodeSandbox here -->\r\n",

This ensures current colour contrast issues which have been observed in both components have been addressed. Also, when the `email` prop is passed on `Portrait` a `Link` component is now rendered with a `mailto: href` allowing users to send emails to the specified email addressed when clicked. Support has also been added for the `text` prop, which is additional text which appears under the email link, this is typically used for phone numbers, but can also be any other relevant read only text. \r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-10-18 at 11 45 57](https://github.com/Sage/carbon/assets/114918852/b59fc869-5090-4531-9f7d-28ff96db61dc)\r\n\r\nA new `darkBackground` variant has been added to `Profile`. This was already present in `Portait` but has been amended to represent new DS designs. This will allow consumers to use `Profile` or `Portait` in Ui which has a dark background. \r\n\r\nFinally, the DS class all text on `Profile` to be optional, when previously in the component they were mandatory. To address this, conditional rendering has been implemented to determine if any text children are present, if true the `Profile` component will be rendered. If false, the `Portrait` component is rendered instead. However, additional guards have also been placed to make sure the `name` prop is passed if consumers do pass text children.\r\n\r\nCode complexity has also been greatly reduced, with both .style files for each component being simplified, with the removal of unnecessary functions, types and interfaces. Resulting in a much cleaner structure and reduction in complexity. Also, both `Portrait` subcomponents `portrait-initials` and `portrait-gravatar` have been removed, with the formers functionality replaced with just rendering a `div` with centred text, and the latters functionality being added to the `Portrait` component.\r\n\r\n### Current behaviour\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of the behaviour before this change.\r\n\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots.

Resulting in a fairly complex component for what is only essentially a rounded or square image or `<div>`.\r\n\r\nNow all gravatar functionality has been moved inside the component file, and the `initials` prop no longer renders an `<img>`, instead it renders a `div` with text centred. \r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Each PR should include the following -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Commits follow our style guide\r\n- [ ] Related issues linked in commit messages if required\r\n- [x] Screenshots are included in the PR if useful\r\n- [ ] All themes are supported if required\r\n- [x] Unit tests added or updated if required\r\n- [ ] Cypress automation tests added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Playwright automation tests added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Storybook added or updated if required\r\n- [ ] Translations added or updated (including creating or amending translation keys table in storybook) if required\r\n- [x] Typescript `d.ts` file added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Related docs have been updated if required\r\n\r\n#### QA\r\n\r\n- [ ] Tested in CodeSandbox/storybook\r\n- [ ] Add new Cypress test coverage if required\r\n- [ ] Carbon implementation matches Design System/designs\r\n- [ ] UI Tests GitHub check reviewed if required\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or links about the pull request here. -->\r\n\r\n### Testing instructions\r\n\r\n<!-- How can a reviewer test this PR? -->\r\n\r\nThe following CodeSandbox is an example of the broken behaviour.\r\nYou can see the new behaviour by looking at the version in the comment by `codesandbox[bot]`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Add CodeSandbox here -->\r\n",

This ensures current colour contrast issues which have been observed in both components have been addressed. Also, when the `email` prop is passed on `Portrait` a `Link` component is now rendered with a `mailto: href` allowing users to send emails to the specified email addressed when clicked. Support has also been added for the `text` prop, which is additional text which appears under the email link, this is typically used for phone numbers, but can also be any other relevant read only text. \r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-10-18 at 11 45 57](https://github.com/Sage/carbon/assets/114918852/b59fc869-5090-4531-9f7d-28ff96db61dc)\r\n\r\nA new `darkBackground` variant has been added to `Profile`. This was already present in `Portait` but has been amended to represent new DS designs. This will allow consumers to use `Profile` or `Portait` in Ui which has a dark background. \r\n\r\nFinally, the DS class all text on `Profile` to be optional, when previously in the component they were mandatory. To address this, conditional rendering has been implemented to determine if any text children are present, if true the `Profile` component will be rendered. If false, the `Portrait` component is rendered instead. However, additional guards have also been placed to make sure the `name` prop is passed if consumers do pass text children.\r\n\r\nCode complexity has also been greatly reduced, with both .style files for each component being simplified, with the removal of unnecessary functions, types and interfaces. Resulting in a much cleaner structure and reduction in complexity. Also, both `Portrait` subcomponents `portrait-initials` and `portrait-gravatar` have been removed, with the formers functionality replaced with just rendering a `div` with centred text, and the latters functionality being added to the `Portrait` component.\r\n\r\n### Current behaviour\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of the behaviour before this change.\r\n\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots.

Resulting in a fairly complex component for what is only essentially a rounded or square image or `<div>`.\r\n\r\nNow all gravatar functionality has been moved inside the component file, and the `initials` prop no longer renders an `<img>`, instead it renders a `div` with text centred. \r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Each PR should include the following -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Commits follow our style guide\r\n- [ ] Related issues linked in commit messages if required\r\n- [x] Screenshots are included in the PR if useful\r\n- [ ] All themes are supported if required\r\n- [x] Unit tests added or updated if required\r\n- [ ] Cypress automation tests added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Playwright automation tests added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Storybook added or updated if required\r\n- [ ] Translations added or updated (including creating or amending translation keys table in storybook) if required\r\n- [x] Typescript `d.ts` file added or updated if required\r\n- [x] Related docs have been updated if required\r\n\r\n#### QA\r\n\r\n- [ ] Tested in CodeSandbox/storybook\r\n- [ ] Add new Cypress test coverage if required\r\n- [ ] Carbon implementation matches Design System/designs\r\n- [ ] UI Tests GitHub check reviewed if required\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or links about the pull request here. -->\r\n\r\n### Testing instructions\r\n\r\n<!-- How can a reviewer test this PR? -->\r\n\r\nThe following CodeSandbox is an example of the broken behaviour.\r\nYou can see the new behaviour by looking at the version in the comment by `codesandbox[bot]`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Add CodeSandbox here -->\r\n",
