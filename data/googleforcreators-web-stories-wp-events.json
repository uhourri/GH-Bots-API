Thus, parent `div` container of the `amp-story-captions` won't reflect the actual size of the `amp-story-captions`.\r\n\r\nThis will fix this issue by setting `max-height` of the `amp-story-grid-layer.align-bottom` exactly to the shadow-dom component.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, fixed-height layout of the `amp-story-captions` is changed to container in order to occupy only required space.\r\n\r\n## User-facing changes\r\n\r\nNot applicable.\r\n\r\n## Testing Instructions\r\n\r\nFollow #13425 for the testing instruction.\r\n\r\n## Reviews\r\n\r\n### Does this PR have a security-related impact?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR change what data or activity we track or use?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR have a legal-related impact?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Check these after PR creation -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR addresses an existing issue and I have linked this PR to it\r\n- [ ] I have tested this code to the best of my abilities\r\n- [ ] I have verified accessibility to the best of my abilities ([docs](https://github.com/googleforcreators/web-stories-wp/blob/main/docs/accessibility-testing.md))\r\n- [ ] I have verified i18n and l10n (translation, right-to-left layout) to the best of my abilities\r\n- [ ] This code is covered by automated tests (unit, integration, and/or e2e) to verify it works as intended ([docs](https://github.com/googleforcreators/web-stories-wp/tree/main/docs#testing))\r\n- [ ] I have added documentation where necessary\r\n- [ ] I have added a matching `Type: XYZ` label to the PR\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFixes #13425\r\n",

Thus, parent `div` container of the `amp-story-captions` won't reflect the actual size of the `amp-story-captions`.\r\n\r\nThis will fix this issue by setting `max-height` of the `amp-story-grid-layer.align-bottom` exactly to the shadow-dom component.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, fixed-height layout of the `amp-story-captions` is changed to container in order to occupy only required space.\r\n\r\n## User-facing changes\r\n\r\nNot applicable.\r\n\r\n## Testing Instructions\r\n\r\nFollow #13425 for the testing instruction.\r\n\r\n## Reviews\r\n\r\n### Does this PR have a security-related impact?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR change what data or activity we track or use?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR have a legal-related impact?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Check these after PR creation -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR addresses an existing issue and I have linked this PR to it\r\n- [ ] I have tested this code to the best of my abilities\r\n- [ ] I have verified accessibility to the best of my abilities ([docs](https://github.com/googleforcreators/web-stories-wp/blob/main/docs/accessibility-testing.md))\r\n- [ ] I have verified i18n and l10n (translation, right-to-left layout) to the best of my abilities\r\n- [ ] This code is covered by automated tests (unit, integration, and/or e2e) to verify it works as intended ([docs](https://github.com/googleforcreators/web-stories-wp/tree/main/docs#testing))\r\n- [ ] I have added documentation where necessary\r\n- [ ] I have added a matching `Type: XYZ` label to the PR\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFixes #13425\r\n",
