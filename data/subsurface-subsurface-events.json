I hope this is not too aggressive, but it really annoys me. In particular, it stops progress on the profile-to-QtQuick project. For the stats it seems to work, but I am not sure the profile is happy when the view is constantly destroyed. There, the connection between widget and view is much more convoluted.\r\n\r\n@dirkhh: please check.",

Adding a new dive manually and importing the media from a local disk, they are shown on the graph immediately after importing them \u2013 but as soon as I switch to another dive and return they are gone from the profile, while remaining in the media tab (e.g. similar to what is described in #2833 \u2013 with the difference that for me they never show up again in the profile even if I toggle all the buttons).\r\n\r\nScrolling through my dives to older ones I saw media are shown for those (dives 92 and before with the attached XML). Looking for the difference I noticed they are shown for all dives where data from a \"real dive computer\" exist (I had one once but it broke) \u2013 but for none of the others.\r\n\r\n### Operating system:\r\n* OS: Linux Mint 20.3\r\n* desktop PC (no DC anymore, data entered manually, never imported from a DC before as mine was broken before I started with Subsurface)\r\n* cannot test on another OS as I run only Linux\r\n\r\n### Subsurface version:\r\n* Subsurface 0.5.10 (latest AppImage)\r\n* not tested on another version (if you let me know which I shall test, I can take a look)\r\n* official release (AppImage downloaded [from the official place](https://subsurface.github.io/download/))\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce:\r\n1. manually add a dive and fill in the details\r\n2. go to the media tab, right click, selecting files from local disk which fit into the time frame of the dive (my ActionCam has the correct time set)\r\n3. see their thumbs showing up in the tab and as well on the profile graph\r\n4. switch to any other dive previously imported/added\r\n5. switch back to the new dive: media still in the tab, but no longer in the profile graph.\r\n\r\n### Current behavior:\r\nMedia disappear from the profile graph after having shown up correctly mapped at the initial import.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior:\r\nMedia showing up in the profile graph every time the corresponding dive record is selected\r\n\r\n### Additional information:\r\nHere's my XML file (extracted around 1 MB) zipped: [xml.zip](https://github.com/subsurface/subsurface/files/13034607/xml.zip). I can reproduce the issue every single time I open it with Subsurface.\r\n\r\n### Mentions:\r\n<!-- Mention users that you want to review your issue with @<user-name>. Leave empty if not sure. -->\r\n",
