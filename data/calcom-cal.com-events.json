What happens if I get invited to a team I don't want to be in and they add me to an event type? Will I get event notifications until I abandon the team or reject the invite?\r\n\r\n@zomars @PeerRich We can make it so that when a pending team member is assigned an event type, they won't receive any event notifications till they don't accept the invitation. This will allow team admins to create teams, add and assign members to different event types as well as not clutter the members emails. What are your thought on this?\r\n",
