See https://crbug.com/1248479.\r\n\r\n**Testing:**\r\n\r\n*Can these tested using a demo application? Please provide reproducible step-by-step instructions.*\r\n1. Have attendee A join with the `Set fullband music (stereo) quality` selected (this will cause the audio frames to be especially large due to the higher quality)\r\n2. Have attendee B join normally\r\n3. Start content share from attendee A, select a tab that actually has audio, and enable the `Also share tab audio` option\r\n4. Use Network Link Conditioner to simulate >20% downlink packet loss (this will cause the downlink packets to contain up to 2 extra RED packets and have up to 3x the audio payload size)\r\n5. Attendee B should *NOT* see the `Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: Failed to execute 'write' on 'UnderlyingSinkBase': Frame too large` error and Attendee B should receive audio normally\r\n\r\n**Checklist:**\r\n\r\n1. Have you successfully run `npm run build:release` locally?\r\ny\r\n\r\n2. Do you add, modify, or delete public API definitions? If yes, has that been reviewed and approved?\r\nn\r\n\r\n3. Do you change the wire protocol, e.g. the request method? If yes, has that been reviewed and approved?\r\nn\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n\r\n",

See https://crbug.com/1248479.\r\n\r\n**Testing:**\r\n\r\n*Can these tested using a demo application? Please provide reproducible step-by-step instructions.*\r\n1. Have attendee A join with the `Set fullband music (stereo) quality` selected (this will cause the audio frames to be especially large due to the higher quality)\r\n2. Have attendee B join normally\r\n3. Start content share from attendee A, select a tab that actually has audio, and enable the `Also share tab audio` option\r\n4. Use Network Link Conditioner to simulate >20% downlink packet loss (this will cause the downlink packets to contain up to 2 extra RED packets and have up to 3x the audio payload size)\r\n5. Attendee B should *NOT* see the `Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: Failed to execute 'write' on 'UnderlyingSinkBase': Frame too large` error and Attendee B should receive audio normally\r\n\r\n**Checklist:**\r\n\r\n1. Have you successfully run `npm run build:release` locally?\r\ny\r\n\r\n2. Do you add, modify, or delete public API definitions? If yes, has that been reviewed and approved?\r\nn\r\n\r\n3. Do you change the wire protocol, e.g. the request method? If yes, has that been reviewed and approved?\r\nn\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n\r\n",

See https://crbug.com/1248479.\r\n\r\n**Testing:**\r\n\r\n*Can these tested using a demo application? Please provide reproducible step-by-step instructions.*\r\n1. Have attendee A join with the `Set fullband music (stereo) quality` selected (this will cause the audio frames to be especially large due to the higher quality)\r\n2. Have attendee B join normally\r\n3. Start content share from attendee A, select a tab that actually has audio, and enable the `Also share tab audio` option\r\n4. Use Network Link Conditioner to simulate >20% downlink packet loss (this will cause the downlink packets to contain up to 2 extra RED packets and have up to 3x the audio payload size)\r\n5. Attendee B should *NOT* see the `Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: Failed to execute 'write' on 'UnderlyingSinkBase': Frame too large` error and Attendee B should receive audio normally\r\n\r\n**Checklist:**\r\n\r\n1. Have you successfully run `npm run build:release` locally?\r\ny\r\n\r\n2. Do you add, modify, or delete public API definitions? If yes, has that been reviewed and approved?\r\nn\r\n\r\n3. Do you change the wire protocol, e.g. the request method? If yes, has that been reviewed and approved?\r\nn\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n\r\n",

See https://crbug.com/1248479.\r\n\r\n**Testing:**\r\n\r\n*Can these tested using a demo application? Please provide reproducible step-by-step instructions.*\r\n1. Have attendee A join with the `Set fullband music (stereo) quality` selected (this will cause the audio frames to be especially large due to the higher quality)\r\n2. Have attendee B join normally\r\n3. Start content share from attendee A, select a tab that actually has audio, and enable the `Also share tab audio` option\r\n4. Use Network Link Conditioner to simulate >20% downlink packet loss (this will cause the downlink packets to contain up to 2 extra RED packets and have up to 3x the audio payload size)\r\n5. Attendee B should *NOT* see the `Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: Failed to execute 'write' on 'UnderlyingSinkBase': Frame too large` error and Attendee B should receive audio normally\r\n\r\n**Checklist:**\r\n\r\n1. Have you successfully run `npm run build:release` locally?\r\ny\r\n\r\n2. Do you add, modify, or delete public API definitions? If yes, has that been reviewed and approved?\r\nn\r\n\r\n3. Do you change the wire protocol, e.g. the request method? If yes, has that been reviewed and approved?\r\nn\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n\r\n",

See https://crbug.com/1248479.\r\n\r\n**Testing:**\r\n\r\n*Can these tested using a demo application? Please provide reproducible step-by-step instructions.*\r\n1. Have attendee A join with the `Set fullband music (stereo) quality` selected (this will cause the audio frames to be especially large due to the higher quality)\r\n2. Have attendee B join normally\r\n3. Start content share from attendee A, select a tab that actually has audio, and enable the `Also share tab audio` option\r\n4. Use Network Link Conditioner to simulate >20% downlink packet loss (this will cause the downlink packets to contain up to 2 extra RED packets and have up to 3x the audio payload size)\r\n5. Attendee B should *NOT* see the `Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: Failed to execute 'write' on 'UnderlyingSinkBase': Frame too large` error and Attendee B should receive audio normally\r\n\r\n**Checklist:**\r\n\r\n1. Have you successfully run `npm run build:release` locally?\r\ny\r\n\r\n2. Do you add, modify, or delete public API definitions? If yes, has that been reviewed and approved?\r\nn\r\n\r\n3. Do you change the wire protocol, e.g. the request method? If yes, has that been reviewed and approved?\r\nn\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n\r\n",

See https://crbug.com/1248479.\r\n\r\n**Testing:**\r\n\r\n*Can these tested using a demo application? Please provide reproducible step-by-step instructions.*\r\n1. Have attendee A join with the `Set fullband music (stereo) quality` selected (this will cause the audio frames to be especially large due to the higher quality)\r\n2. Have attendee B join normally\r\n3. Start content share from attendee A, select a tab that actually has audio, and enable the `Also share tab audio` option\r\n4. Use Network Link Conditioner to simulate >20% downlink packet loss (this will cause the downlink packets to contain up to 2 extra RED packets and have up to 3x the audio payload size)\r\n5. Attendee B should *NOT* see the `Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: Failed to execute 'write' on 'UnderlyingSinkBase': Frame too large` error and Attendee B should receive audio normally\r\n\r\n**Checklist:**\r\n\r\n1. Have you successfully run `npm run build:release` locally?\r\ny\r\n\r\n2. Do you add, modify, or delete public API definitions? If yes, has that been reviewed and approved?\r\nn\r\n\r\n3. Do you change the wire protocol, e.g. the request method? If yes, has that been reviewed and approved?\r\nn\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n\r\n",

See https://crbug.com/1248479.\r\n\r\n**Testing:**\r\n\r\n*Can these tested using a demo application? Please provide reproducible step-by-step instructions.*\r\n1. Have attendee A join with the `Set fullband music (stereo) quality` selected (this will cause the audio frames to be especially large due to the higher quality)\r\n2. Have attendee B join normally\r\n3. Start content share from attendee A, select a tab that actually has audio, and enable the `Also share tab audio` option\r\n4. Use Network Link Conditioner to simulate >20% downlink packet loss (this will cause the downlink packets to contain up to 2 extra RED packets and have up to 3x the audio payload size)\r\n5. Attendee B should *NOT* see the `Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: Failed to execute 'write' on 'UnderlyingSinkBase': Frame too large` error and Attendee B should receive audio normally\r\n\r\n**Checklist:**\r\n\r\n1. Have you successfully run `npm run build:release` locally?\r\ny\r\n\r\n2. Do you add, modify, or delete public API definitions? If yes, has that been reviewed and approved?\r\nn\r\n\r\n3. Do you change the wire protocol, e.g. the request method? If yes, has that been reviewed and approved?\r\nn\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n\r\n",

See https://crbug.com/1248479.\r\n\r\n**Testing:**\r\n\r\n*Can these tested using a demo application? Please provide reproducible step-by-step instructions.*\r\n1. Have attendee A join with the `Set fullband music (stereo) quality` selected (this will cause the audio frames to be especially large due to the higher quality)\r\n2. Have attendee B join normally\r\n3. Start content share from attendee A, select a tab that actually has audio, and enable the `Also share tab audio` option\r\n4. Use Network Link Conditioner to simulate >20% downlink packet loss (this will cause the downlink packets to contain up to 2 extra RED packets and have up to 3x the audio payload size)\r\n5. Attendee B should *NOT* see the `Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: Failed to execute 'write' on 'UnderlyingSinkBase': Frame too large` error and Attendee B should receive audio normally\r\n\r\n**Checklist:**\r\n\r\n1. Have you successfully run `npm run build:release` locally?\r\ny\r\n\r\n2. Do you add, modify, or delete public API definitions? If yes, has that been reviewed and approved?\r\nn\r\n\r\n3. Do you change the wire protocol, e.g. the request method? If yes, has that been reviewed and approved?\r\nn\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n\r\n",

See https://crbug.com/1248479.\r\n\r\n**Testing:**\r\n\r\n*Can these tested using a demo application? Please provide reproducible step-by-step instructions.*\r\n1. Have attendee A join with the `Set fullband music (stereo) quality` selected (this will cause the audio frames to be especially large due to the higher quality)\r\n2. Have attendee B join normally\r\n3. Start content share from attendee A, select a tab that actually has audio, and enable the `Also share tab audio` option\r\n4. Use Network Link Conditioner to simulate >20% downlink packet loss (this will cause the downlink packets to contain up to 2 extra RED packets and have up to 3x the audio payload size)\r\n5. Attendee B should *NOT* see the `Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: Failed to execute 'write' on 'UnderlyingSinkBase': Frame too large` error and Attendee B should receive audio normally\r\n\r\n**Checklist:**\r\n\r\n1. Have you successfully run `npm run build:release` locally?\r\ny\r\n\r\n2. Do you add, modify, or delete public API definitions? If yes, has that been reviewed and approved?\r\nn\r\n\r\n3. Do you change the wire protocol, e.g. the request method? If yes, has that been reviewed and approved?\r\nn\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n\r\n",

See https://crbug.com/1248479.\r\n\r\n**Testing:**\r\n\r\n*Can these tested using a demo application? Please provide reproducible step-by-step instructions.*\r\n1. Have attendee A join with the `Set fullband music (stereo) quality` selected (this will cause the audio frames to be especially large due to the higher quality)\r\n2. Have attendee B join normally\r\n3. Start content share from attendee A, select a tab that actually has audio, and enable the `Also share tab audio` option\r\n4. Use Network Link Conditioner to simulate >20% downlink packet loss (this will cause the downlink packets to contain up to 2 extra RED packets and have up to 3x the audio payload size)\r\n5. Attendee B should *NOT* see the `Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: Failed to execute 'write' on 'UnderlyingSinkBase': Frame too large` error and Attendee B should receive audio normally\r\n\r\n**Checklist:**\r\n\r\n1. Have you successfully run `npm run build:release` locally?\r\ny\r\n\r\n2. Do you add, modify, or delete public API definitions? If yes, has that been reviewed and approved?\r\nn\r\n\r\n3. Do you change the wire protocol, e.g. the request method? If yes, has that been reviewed and approved?\r\nn\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n\r\n",
