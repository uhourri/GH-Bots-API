But version 21 doesn't work.\r\nI'm running a docker container on an Oracle Ampere machine (arm64) \r\nChromium is installed by docker using `RUN apt-get install chromium -y`\r\nDocker image is `node:gallium-buster`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expectation\r\n\r\nBrowser should start and should be accessible.\r\n\r\n### Reality\r\n\r\nProcess hangs and does nothing. \r\nFirst time it fails because it is not able to run chrome that comes installed with puppeteer. Then it looks up chromium installed by apt and it seems that it is okay. I get a message about deprecated headless mode. But then it hangs. I can see chromium process started by examining `ps -aux` there is e.g. \r\n```\r\nroot        1041  0.0  0.2 38804488 65652 ?

[This question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55237748/how-to-get-text-inside-div-in-puppeteer) on StackOverflow has gathered 121'000 views, 54+ upvotes, and 8 answers (with plenty of upvotes also).\r\n\r\nAnd there [are](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68158601/using-puppeteer-to-extract-text-from-span) [multiple](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66173666/how-to-get-html-element-text-using-puppeteer) [such](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71639420/puppeteer-how-to-extract-content-from-a-page-that-have-multiple-divs-with-same) [questions]()\r\n\r\n## Symptoms\r\n\r\nSo our code is filled with :\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst theElement = page.waitForSelector(sel);\r\nconst theText = theElement.$eval(el => el.innerText)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis two-liner seems redundant. I also have this a lot:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet studData = {\r\n            name:       await student.$eval('td:nth-of-type(1)', el => el.innerText),\r\n            department: await student.$eval('td:nth-of-type(2)', el => el.innerText),\r\n            date:       await student.$eval(`td:nth-of-type(4)`, el => el.innerText),\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Current workaround\r\n\r\nNone yielded from my search.\r\n\r\nI tried to extend `ElementHandle` or `JSHandle`, but it doesn't work:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    // extend Element to be able to get text directly\r\n    puppeteer.ElementHandle.prototype.getText = async function(selector) {\r\n        return this.$eval(selector, el => el.innerText);\r\n      };\r\n```\r\nI'm not a typescript guy, but I believe [this answers](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66327189/786559) why this cannot work. \r\n\r\n## Desired feature\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be a lot more elegant if we had `ElementHandle.getText(selector)` ? \r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet studData = {\r\n            name:       await student.getText('td:nth-of-type(1)'),\r\n            department: await student.getText('td:nth-of-type(2)'),\r\n            date:       await student.getText(`td:nth-of-type(4)`),\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr it could be called `student.$text()`. The `$` still indicates we'll take a selector as first argument.\r\n\r\n## Alternative \r\n\r\nMaybe even a custom QuerySelector that doesn't just search for text, but actually returns it . (although this is not such a good solution because it woudl return string so it breaks the interface of returning a `HandleFor`)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAny of these interfaces would save a lot of intermediate steps.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Then it looks up chromium installed by apt and it seems that it is okay. I get a message about deprecated headless mode. But then it hangs. I can see chromium process started by examining `ps -aux` there is e.g. \r\n```\r\nroot        1041  0.0  0.2 38804488 65652 ?

But those are only my guesses.\r\n\r\n### Puppeteer configuration file (if used)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Puppeteer version\r\n\r\n21.3.8\r\n\r\n### Node version\r\n\r\n16.20.2\r\n\r\n### Package manager\r\n\r\nnpm\r\n\r\n### Package manager version\r\n\r\n9.8.1\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nLinux",

I got it running with `google-chrome-stable` but on amd64 not on **arm64**.\r\n\r\nSo I tried what was recommended by @OrKoN \r\n\r\n> I am unable to reproduce locally. Please see https://pptr.dev/troubleshooting#running-puppeteer-in-docker as the issue is probably related to the docker image. Consider trying the following: 1) checking that all dependencies are installed https://pptr.dev/troubleshooting#chrome-doesnt-launch-on-linux 2) configure the sandbox 3) make sure dbus is started and has a proper DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS in the env vars.\r\n\r\nI installed everything i found in available dockerfiles. I configured sandbox (`args: [\"--no-sandbox\", \"--disable-setuid-sandbox\"],`) and I checked dbus and it wasn't started but even if I start it, there's no change.\r\n\r\nThe issue is, that chromium gets started, I can see it in `ps -aux` output.\r\n\r\nI understand that, you are not supporting chromium, but what are we supposed to do on arm?
