Looking at the design documentation it even was created with fault tolerance in mind.

                    "message": "Reworked config tags, adopted rflags/wflags/oflags\n\nThe biggest change here is the breaking up of the FLAGS config into\nRFLAGS/WFLAGS/OFLAGS. This is directly inspired by, and honestly not\nmuch more than a renaming, of the compat/ro_compat/incompat flags found\nin Linux/Unix/POSIX filesystems.\n\nI think these were first introduced in ext2? But I need to do a bit more\nresearch on that.\n\nRFLAGS/WFLAGS/OFLAGS provide a much more flexible, and extensible,\nfeature flag mechanism than the previous minor version bumps.\n\nThe (re)naming of these flags is intended to make their requirements\nmore clear. In order to do the relevant operation, you must understand\nevery flag set in the relevant flag:\n\n- RFLAGS / incompat flags - All flags must be understood to read the\n  filesystem, if not understood the only possible behavior is to fail.\n\n- WFLAGS / ro-compat flags - All flags must be understood to write to the\n  filesystem, if not understood the filesystem may be mounted read-only.\n\n- OFLAGS / compat flags - Optional flags, if not understood the relevant\n  flag must be cleared before the filesystem can be written to, but other\n  than that these flags can mostly be ignored.\n\nSome hypothetical littlefs examples:\n\n- RFLAGS / incompat flags - Transparent compression\n\n  Is this the same as a major disk-version break? Yes kinda? An\n  implementation that doesn't understand compression can't read the\n  filesystem.\n\n  On the other hand, it's useful to have a filesystem that can read both\n  compressed and uncompressed variants.\n\n- WFLAGS / ro-compat flags - Closed block-map\n\n  The idea behind a closed block-map (currently planned), is that\n  littlefs maintains in global space a complete mapping of all blocks in\n  use by the filesystem.\n\n  For such a mapping to remain consistent means that if you write to the\n  filesystem you must understand the closed block-map. Or in other\n  words, if you don't understand the closed block-map you must not write\n  to the filesystem.\n\n  Reading, on the other hand, can ignore many such write-related\n  auxiliary features, so the filesystem can still be read from.\n\n- OFLAGS / compat flags - Global checksums\n\n  Global checksums (currently planned) are extra checksums attached to\n  each mdir that when combined self-validate the filesystem.\n\n  But if you don't understand global checksums, you can still read and\n  write the filesystem without them. The only catch is that when you write\n  to the filesystem, you may end up invalidating the global checksum.\n\n  Clearing the global checksum bit in the OFLAGS is a cheap way to\n  signal that the global checksum is no longer valid, allowing you to\n  still write to the filesystem without this optional feature.\n\nOther tweaks to note:\n\n- Renamed BLOCKLIMIT/DISKLIMIT -> BLOCKSIZE/BLOCKCOUNT\n\n  Note these are still the _actual_ block_size/block_count minus 1. The\n  subtle difference here was the original reason for the name change,\n  but after working with it for a bit, I just don't think new, otherwise\n  unused, names are worth it.\n\n  The minus 1 stays, however, since it avoids overflow issues at\n  extreme boundaries of powers of 2.\n\n- Introduces STAGLIMIT/SATTRLIMIT, sys-attribute parallels to\n  UTAGLIMIT/UATTRLIMIT.\n\n  These may be useful if only uattrs are supported, or vice-versa.\n\n- Dropped UATTRLIMIT/SATTRLIMIT to 255 bytes.\n\n  This feels extreme, but matches NAMELIMIT. These _should_ be small,\n  and limiting the uattr/sattr size to a single-byte leads to really\n  nice packing of the utag+uattrsize in a single integer.\n\n  This can always be expanded in the future if this limit proves to be a\n  problem.\n\n- Renamed MLEAFLIMIT -> MDIRLIMIT and (re?)introduced MTREELIMIT.\n\n  These may be useful to limiting the mtree when needed, though it's not\n  clear the exact use case quite yet.",

What we have looked at so far looks promising (corse overview so far only), but following the issue tracker there are likely some places in the code we might need to follow up on. We'll provide feedback on our findings as soon as there's something noteworthy. @geky If you have any particular areas of interest that we should take a look at, feel free to ping me.\n\n*usually only a few hours per week, idea based on [this presentation](https://media.ccc.de/v/rc3-2021-cwtv-228-lets-review-code-toget) (sorry, German only).",

                "body": "To give a concrete example, here is a relatively simple case where attempting to fix a -Wshadow warning would risk breaking code:\r\n\r\n``` c\r\n// close the floomeister\r\nint floomeister_close(floomeister_t *floomeister) {\r\n    int err = floomeister_freethepidgeons(floomeister);\r\n\r\n    // if pidgeons cannot be freed, we need to wake the hibernating bear before we return\r\n    if (err) {\r\n        bear_t *bear = floomeister_getbear(floomeister);\r\n        if (bear_ishibernating(bear)) {\r\n            alarm_t *alarm = bear_getleastfavoritealarm(bear);\r\n\r\n            int err = bear_wake(alarm);\r\n            if (err) {\r\n                return err;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // return the original error\r\n    return err;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSituations like this can easily happen when copying complex chunks of code around. Keep in mind there may be more layers of code between the two declarations.\r\n\r\nWe should of course prefer simpler code paths when possible, and littlefs prefers to resolve `err` variables immediately, but this can't always be avoided and I think -Wshadow does more harm than good here.\r\n\r\nI think @BenBE's comment (https://github.com/littlefs-project/littlefs/pull/873#issuecomment-1776772763) does a good job of listing the possible options for resolving -Wshadow warnings:\r\n\r\n1. Move all `err` variables up to function scope - This is the unnecessary increase of scope I mentioned. It risks variables interacting in unintended ways, like in the above example.\r\n\r\n2. Introducing a new scope for each `err` - This is probably the best solution in terms of bug-resistant code, and I'm a fan, but it comes with a readability cost. It also does not work with the above example.\r\n\r\n3. Rename conflicting `err` instances - I believe this is the correct way to resolve the above example if you want -Wshadow. But these variables have the same purpose, so having a similar name helps readability. This leads to names like `err1`, `err2`, etc, and introduces the possiblity of accidentally using `err5` when you mean `err4`. It also makes complicates copying chunks of code around.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt's interesting to note that Rust goes in the opposite direction, allowing shadowing even in the same scope ([ref](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/variable_bindings/scope.html)). If this were adopted in C, tightly-scoped `err` variables would become much more pleasant to write:\r\n\r\n``` c\r\nint do_many_things(void) {\r\n    int err = do_thing_one();\r\n    if (err) {\r\n        return err;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    int err = do_thing_two();\r\n    if (err) {\r\n        return err;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    int err = do_thing_three();\r\n    if (err) {\r\n        return err;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nvs solution 2. with -Wshadow:\r\n\r\n``` c\r\nint do_many_things(void) {\r\n    {\r\n        int err = do_thing_one();\r\n        if (err) {\r\n            return err;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    {\r\n        int err = do_thing_two();\r\n        if (err) {\r\n            return err;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    {\r\n        int err = do_thing_three();\r\n        if (err) {\r\n            return err;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n-Wshadow does protect against when you intended to mutate a variable in an outer scope, but from my experience this hasn't been that common? Maybe I need to use more global variables.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@BenBE, regarding more compiler flags: I'm not opposed to adopting warnings that are useful, but so far it seems like warnings not included in -Wextra have been excluded for good reason. Either because of questionable value, false positives, or, worst case, [compiler bugs](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=60784).\r\n\r\nI think it would be more interesting to explore other static analysis tools, such as cppcheck. Limiting such tools (or more compiler flags) to CI would be a good compromise for producing safer releases without suffering from warning overload during development.\r\n\r\nBut IMO this is relatively low priority right now, since there is still a lot of code moving around to address littlefs's functional issues.",

                "body": "Hi @alofthouse, good question.\r\n\r\nI can see how `LFS_TYPE_FROM` missing from SPEC.md would be confusing. The reason for this is because `LFS_TYPE_FROM` should never actually be written to disk.\r\n\r\nSPEC.md is only concerned with how the disk is organized, and another hypothetical driver is free to ignore `LFS_TYPE_FROM` completely.\r\n\r\nDisk aside, in this driver it's useful to have a couple internal-only tags that tell `lfs_dir_commit` to do something a bit more complex than write a tag:\r\n\r\n- `0x101` `LFS_FROM_MOVE` - Copy over all tags associated with this id. This is fundamental for implementing atomic moves.\r\n- `0x102` `LFS_FROM_USERATTRS` - Write a set of userattrs.\r\n\r\nYou may have noticed these types tend to follow some patterns, with the top 3-bits indicating a sort of \"supertype\", and the lower 8-bits indicating a \"subtype\". For example: `0x2xx` is the supertype for all file structs, and `0x201`, the \"inlinestruct\", is just one specific representation.\r\n\r\nSince we never use the `0x1xx` supertype on disk, it is free to be used in the driver to represent any internal-only tags without risk of conflicts. At least in the current version of littlefs.\r\n\r\nIn theory, the `LFS_TYPE_FROM` supertype could be used with a mask to filter for all internal-only tags, but in practice we haven't needed to do that. Because we don't use it, `LFS_TYPE_FROM` could be removed, but I guess it at least it serves as an internal hint that that range of tags is reserved.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> > which mask depends on unique bit in tag structure\r\n>\r\n> but that suggests this is being used in a way similar to the valid bit instead of the other type identifiers perhaps?\r\n\r\nAh, this is a red-herring. And a subtle (hacky?) part of the tag encoding that is a bit tricky.\r\n\r\nA question came up during development: When do two tags represent the same file attribute?\r\n\r\nClearly `0x301` (user attr `0x01`) and `0x302` (user attr `0x02`) are different attributes. But `0x600` (soft tail) and `0x601` (hard tail) are really the same attribute with a different flag indicating if the tail is soft or hard. If you append a hard tail to a metadata log, it should effectively replace a previous soft tail, not end up with both a soft and hard tail.\r\n\r\nSo the supertypes of the tags were arranges in such a way that the lowest bit indicates if the subtype, the lowest 8-bits, should be included when comparing tags, or ignored. This is why it changes the mask during dir filter. This is also some of why the tag encoding may seem a bit random:\r\n\r\n```\r\n0x4xx  LFS_TYPE_SPLICE    - Don't care, splice tags are ignored in dir filter\r\n0x0xx  LFS_TYPE_NAME      - Don't care, a file should never have more than one name\r\n0x2xx  LFS_TYPE_STRUCT    - Subtype should be ignored, indicates struct encoding\r\n0x3xx  LFS_TYPE_USERATTR  - Subtype is unique, indicates which user attr\r\n0x6xx  LFS_TYPE_TAIL      - Subtype should be ignored, indicates hard vs soft tails\r\n0x7xx  LFS_TYPE_GSTATE    - Subtype is unique, indicates gstate type\r\n0x5xx  LFS_TYPE_CRC       - Don't care, CRC tags are ignored in dir filter\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this a clever solution? An ugly hack? That's up to you to decide : )\r\n",

Some of this is because, in order to get interesting file\ntopologies, we need to move a ton of data around, but some of this is\nalso because our current write implementation has some problematically\nexpensive corner cases.\n\nI have quite a few ideas on how to improve this, but in the meantime the\ntests needed to be aggressively trimmed in order to keep development\ntolerable (A happy developer is a productive developer).\n\nThis mainly meant:\n\n- Disabled powerloss testing on file tests for now.\n\n  The reality is that naivly powerloss testing the file tests, i.e.\n  just truncating the file after each restart, provides very little\n  value and adds an extreme amount of runtime.\n\n  Removed for now. Most of the powerloss file creation concerns are\n  covered in the dtree tests, and we should eventually add powerloss\n  tests tailored to recovering files after powerloss instead of just\n  truncating.\n\n- Avoided tiny fragment sizes with large file sizes.\n\n  Tiny fragments are a degenerate case and end up with excessive\n  overhead (1 byte fragment => 41x overhead!). But they are useful for\n  revealing subtle bugs. Still, it just doesn't make sense time-wise to\n  test with tiny fragments once the file size exceeds ~1 block.\n\n- Limited fuzz tests to cover fewer random seeds.\n\n  We can increase these if performance improves, but even if not, we can\n  run these individually with a high number of seeds in CI.\n\nAlso fixed a number of bugs found by the extended testing, which is\nalways a good sign:\n\n- Yet another `lfsr_data_size(&data)` vs `data.u.disk.size` typo.\n\n  This is the first time I've seen a real world argument for private\n  struct/class fields, but I am still against the concept.\n\n- Fixed delta/weight miscalculation when tree-carving a left sibling.\n\n- Fixed missing offset in hole writing during block writes.\n\n- Worked around lfsr_file_readnext's reliance on file->size when we are\n  using it to write to a block. This may be more a hack than a good\n  long term solution though.\n\n- Checkpointed the allocator in both lfsr_file_write and lfsr_file_sync.\n\n  Otherwise calling lfsr_file_write repeatedly can easily trigger an\n  incorrect ENOSPC.\n\n- Correctly reverted both shrubs and btrees in truncate/fruncate\n\n  This gets a bit more complicated in fruncate, since either one of the\n  two, or both, can revert.\n\n  truncate/fruncate probably deserve a bit more work around reversions\n  to simpler data structures, as is.\n\n- Added handling of shrub overflows during fruncate.\n\n  Notably not possible with truncate, shrub overflows require that we\n  1. flush the shrub, 2. fruncate the tree, 3. and make sure any side\n  effects to the buffer are handled correctly.",

                "body": "Looking at the overall structure of the function, there are several instances of a variable called `err`. The one warning the compiler gives with `-Wshadow` is really just a symptom of this; and the patch only addresses part of the (actual) issue.\r\n\r\nThere are a few possible ways to go about this:\r\n1. Move `err` to the outermost scope of the function and use it as a \"global\" temporary to store error state information (I don't like this, because this messes up scopes)\r\n2. Narrow down the scope for each instance where `err` is used, by introducing a bare pair of braces around it. While this may look strange at first, this is most in spirit with what @geky said re reducing scopes\r\n3. Rename each instance of `err` to have it's own variable name\r\n\r\nOverall, I'd prefer to see the second one implemented with `-Wshadow` being added to the list of CI flags.\r\n\r\nP.S.: @geky There are several quite useful compiler flags not present in `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic` that can provide an early notification about issues. Some of these include:\r\n\r\n- [-Wwrite-strings](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html#index-Wwrite-strings)\r\n- [-Wcast-align](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html#index-Wcast-align)\r\n- [-Wcast-qual](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html#index-Wcast-qual)\r\n- [-Wpointer-arith](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html#index-Wpointer-arith)\r\n- [-Wstrict-aliasing](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html#index-Wstrict-aliasing)\r\n- [-Wformat=2](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html#index-Wformat)\r\n- [-Wuninitialized](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html#index-Wuninitialized)\r\n",

(Why would you encourage programmers to increase a variable's scope more than necessary?).\r\n> \r\n> My current stance is to use GCC/Clang with -Wall -Wextra -pedantic and not use -Wshadow unless it is added to this set of default warnings in GCC or Clang.\r\n> \r\n> I could merge this, but without -Wshadow in littlefs's CI it's likely a shadowed variable gets reintroduced in another patch. I believe the correct thing to do is disable the warning locally when compiling littlefs.\r\n\r\nI would love to have this PR merged as well.\r\n\r\nAnd I do not agree that Wshadow \"encourage programmers to increase a variable's scope more than necessary\" imo it helps. If you want to keep the scope small then its better to change the variable name but still declare it in the small scope. ",
