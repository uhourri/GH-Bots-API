The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",

The number of lines changed is inflated 3 to 4X by two syntactic changes:\r\n\r\n- Renaming the `UtilityRoutines` namespace to `Util`.\r\n- Renaming the `dataWeatherManager` state object to `dataWeather`. As I go through some of these things I am removing the word `Manager` (and some other words too) from module names because it adds nothing. \r\n\r\nThe primary structural are a conversion of a whole bunch of multi-dimensional arrays of scalars to a much smaller number of multi-dimensional arrays of structures. A potential follow-on clean-up pass is to use these structures more intelligently, e.g., as parameters to routines, and to reduce structure copies. ",
