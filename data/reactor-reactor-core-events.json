The `ReactorContextAccessor` class is public but shouldn't generally be accessed by user code.\n \n-On top of that, Reactor-Core 3.5.0 also modifies the behavior of a couple key operators as well as introduces the `contextCapture` operator\n-to transparently deal with `ContextSnapshot`s if the library is available at runtime.\n+Reactor-Core supports two modes of operation with `io.micrometer:context-propagation`:\n \n-== `contextCapture` Operator\n+- the **default** (limited) mode,\n+- and the **automatic** mode, enabled via `Hooks.enableAutomaticContextPropagation()`.\n+  Please note that this mode applies only to new subscriptions, so it is recommended to\n+enable this hook when the application starts.\n+\n+Their key differences are discussed in the context of either <<context-writing, writing\n+data>> to Reactor `Context`, or <<context-accessing,accessing `ThreadLocal` state>> that\n+reflects the contents of the`Context` of currently attached `Subscriber` for reading.\n+\n+The act of discovering the mapping between `ThreadLocal` values and relevant entries in\n+the Reactor `Context` is performed using the registered `ThreadLocalAccessor`(s).",

The `ReactorContextAccessor` class is public but shouldn't generally be accessed by user code.\n \n-On top of that, Reactor-Core 3.5.0 also modifies the behavior of a couple key operators as well as introduces the `contextCapture` operator\n-to transparently deal with `ContextSnapshot`s if the library is available at runtime.\n+Reactor-Core supports two modes of operation with `io.micrometer:context-propagation`:\n \n-== `contextCapture` Operator\n+- the **default** (limited) mode,\n+- and the **automatic** mode, enabled via `Hooks.enableAutomaticContextPropagation()`.\n+  Please note that this mode applies only to new subscriptions, so it is recommended to\n+enable this hook when the application starts.\n+\n+Their key differences are discussed in the context of either <<context-writing, writing\n+data>> to Reactor `Context`, or <<context-accessing,accessing `ThreadLocal` state>> that\n+reflects the contents of the`Context` of currently attached `Subscriber` for reading.\n+\n+The act of discovering the mapping between `ThreadLocal` values and relevant entries in\n+the Reactor `Context` is performed using the registered `ThreadLocalAccessor`(s).\n+\n+[[context-writing]]\n+== Writing to `Context`\n+\n+Depending on the individual application, you might either have to store already populated\n+`ThreadLocal` state as entries in the `Context`, or might only need to directly populate\n+the `Context`.\n+\n+=== `contextCapture` Operator\n This operator can be used when one needs to capture `ThreadLocal` value(s) at subscription time and reflect these values in the Reactor `Context` for the benefit of upstream operators.\n-It relies on the `context-propagation` library and notably the registered `ThreadLocalAccessor`(s) to discover relevant ThreadLocal values.\n \n This is a convenient alternative to `contextWrite` which uses the `context-propagation` API to obtain a `ContextSnapshot` and then uses that snapshot to populate the Reactor `Context`.",
