However, we have a new requirement where we want to disable the DOM for quick connect until the agent has filled the transfer summary in a separate modal. \r\nSince the containerDiv is an iframe and we don't have access to the DOM I believe, but is there a way we can access this DOM and disable it and then enable it again?",

However, since the cookie has the httponly attribute, it seems I cannot delete it from within my code.\r\n\r\nThe environments I tested are:\r\nChrome versions: 117, 118, 119\u03b2\r\nExperimental Flags: Storage Access API, Storage Access API permission UI, Test Third Party Cookie Phaseout all set to enabled.\r\n![\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8 2023-10-24 12 04 47](https://github.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-streams/assets/34177860/328dea8a-b729-4f0f-871a-2fceaacb7fb3)\r\n\r\nI believe there might be a need for a new method in Amazon Connect Streams to log out of the CCP.\r\nWithout this method, the workaround might be to open the logout URL in a separate window, which is visible to the user. I'd like to avoid this as it degrades the user experience.\r\n",

                "body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI am working on updating our Agent app that has a custom CCP to get it ready for the 3P cookie phaseout, but I am struggling with properly implementing and testing the behavior of the new RSA banner. \r\n\r\nI followed the instructions on implementing the 3P phaseout update in the documentation ([here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/admin-3pcookies.html)) and my browser has the following flags turned on:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"742\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-streams/assets/59791512/48ab3d49-f52f-42db-88a0-bb655d346ba8\">\r\n\r\nI tested the RSA banner by disabling 3P cookies in my browser settings:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"692\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-streams/assets/59791512/9c141c75-32ee-4720-a5b8-10ce2840100f\">\r\n\r\nThis way, I was able to trigger the RSA banner in my app:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"815\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-streams/assets/59791512/bcae5fe6-2799-4567-a589-05b9e1e37edc\">\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, whenever I click on the 'Grant Access' button, it simply turns into the deny RSA banner: \r\n\r\n<img width=\"614\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-streams/assets/59791512/9fccb3b6-4995-4caa-adeb-16b2d0d090ce\">\r\n\r\nAlso, as I was updating this yesterday, I was still probably signed in to my session from the older version on my local machine. However, when I am trying to sign in today, with the 3P cookies setting turned on (**so that 3P cookies are allowed**), **I am now unable to sign in at all**,  and the blue RSA banner asking me to Grant Access shows up, but the same issue occurs - the banner just changes to the deny (yellow one) and I can't sign in. This is what shows up in my logs:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"564\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-streams/assets/59791512/9cfddfaf-0346-4195-80d5-c41c6814c38c\">\r\n\r\n\r\nFyi this is the configuration of my CCP:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n const ccpConfig: connect.InitCCPOptions = {\r\n    ccpUrl: app.ccpUrl,\r\n    loginUrl: app.loginUrl,\r\n    loginPopup: true,\r\n    loginPopupAutoClose: true,\r\n    loginOptions: {\r\n      autoClose: true,\r\n      height: 600,\r\n      width: 400,\r\n      top: 0,\r\n      left: 0,\r\n    },\r\n    softphone: {\r\n      allowFramedSoftphone: true,\r\n    },\r\n    storageAccess: {\r\n      canRequest: true,\r\n      mode: 'custom',\r\n    },\r\n  };\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny ideas on how to fix this issue with the banner and how to test the functionality of the 3P cookie phaseout before it goes live?",

We found a workaround, which is to have the agent log in at least once to Connect directly. After that, the third party workflow in the embedded CCP works as expected.\r\n\r\nIt's not a great work-around, but unsure how you can deal with this at a code-level as it sort of makes sense that Chrome wouldn't take a third party cookie for site the end user hasn't interacted with at top level, but I'm not a expert.

It doesn't seem like streams API has anything that would indicate if a call is being recorded and if so, which parties. The Connect API doesn't seem to have a method like getContactRecordingStatus either.\r\n\r\nAs a bad work around I am calling startContactRecording on the contact to see if it errors with \"Request is not allowed in current voice recording state\". The down side is if it's not being recorded, there will now be a short recording while the stopContactRecording request is handled. \r\n\r\nHopefully I'm missing some really easy way to do this.

There is no obvious workaround at the moment and we're having to notify customers as we have no control over the CCP version embedded in the iframe**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt appears the CCP has pushed a release that has now impacted all application using connect streams, with an embedded CCP using `initCCP`. This has been tested in our app, a barebones app with just `initCCP` and even using the browser console/window connect with the `awsapps.com` CCP directly.\r\n\r\n**Problem**\r\nThe CCP automatically unmutes the Agent, several seconds after a call to mute the agent using `agent.mute()`.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n\r\n- Init the CCP\r\n- Use the connect streams method `agent.mute()`\r\n- Observe in the console + visually in the CCP that the agent becomes unmuted after a few seconds\r\n\r\n\r\n**Trying to find the issue:**\r\n_Nothing in any of our app source code calls unmute, as mentioned above, this is reproducible on the AWS connect website directly._\r\n\r\nOverriding minified files (the main.js chunk in the CCP react app), I've tracked down the following method calling unmute in the `SoftphoneContactService` file (minified):\r\n\r\n```\r\n syncLocalAndRemoteMute() {\r\n    const e = this.getContactContext()\r\n      , t = e.currentContactState.isOnMute\r\n      , n = e.currentContactState.isSoftphoneEnabled\r\n      , a = this.getAgentConnection();\r\n\r\n    a && a.isMute !== t && (n ? this.service.muteToggle(a.isMute) : this.updateContactContext({\r\n        isOnMute: a.isMute\r\n    }))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis consistently calls `this.service.muteToggle(false)` as the connection mute status is always `false` and the local mute status is `true`.\r\n\r\nInterestingly in an old copy of the CCP source code this method looked like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  syncLocalAndRemoteMute() {\r\n        if (this.isMultiparty()) {\r\n            const context = this.getContactContext();\r\n            const isOnMute = context.currentContactState.isOnMute;\r\n            const isSoftphoneEnabled = context.currentContactState.isSoftphoneEnabled;\r\n            const agentConnection = this.getAgentConnection();\r\n            if (agentConnection && agentConnection.isMute !== isOnMute) {\r\n                if (isSoftphoneEnabled) {\r\n                    this.service.muteToggle(agentConnection.isMute);\r\n                } else {\r\n                    this.updateContactContext({\r\n                        isOnMute: agentConnection.isMute\r\n                    });\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like the check for multi party has been removed and this method now runs far more often, including throughout normal calls.",

This has been tested in our app, a barebones app with just `initCCP` and even using the browser console/window connect with the `awsapps.com` CCP directly.\r\n\r\n**Problem**\r\nThe CCP automatically unmutes the Agent, several seconds after a call to mute the agent using `agent.mute()`.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n\r\n- Init the CCP\r\n- Use the connect streams method `agent.mute()`\r\n- Observe in the console + visually in the CCP that the agent becomes unmuted after a few seconds\r\n\r\n\r\n**Trying to find the issue:**\r\n_Nothing in any of our app source code calls unmute, as mentioned above, this is reproducible on the AWS connect website directly._\r\n\r\nOverriding minified files (the main.js chunk in the CCP react app), I've tracked down the following method calling unmute in the `SoftphoneContactService` file (minified):\r\n\r\n```\r\n syncLocalAndRemoteMute() {\r\n    const e = this.getContactContext()\r\n      , t = e.currentContactState.isOnMute\r\n      , n = e.currentContactState.isSoftphoneEnabled\r\n      , a = this.getAgentConnection();\r\n\r\n    a && a.isMute !== t && (n ? this.service.muteToggle(a.isMute) : this.updateContactContext({\r\n        isOnMute: a.isMute\r\n    }))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis consistently calls `this.service.muteToggle(false)` as the connection mute status is always `false` and the local mute status is `true`.\r\n\r\nInterestingly in an old copy of the CCP source code this method looked like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  syncLocalAndRemoteMute() {\r\n        if (this.isMultiparty()) {\r\n            const context = this.getContactContext();\r\n            const isOnMute = context.currentContactState.isOnMute;\r\n            const isSoftphoneEnabled = context.currentContactState.isSoftphoneEnabled;\r\n            const agentConnection = this.getAgentConnection();\r\n            if (agentConnection && agentConnection.isMute !== isOnMute) {\r\n                if (isSoftphoneEnabled) {\r\n                    this.service.muteToggle(agentConnection.isMute);\r\n                } else {\r\n                    this.updateContactContext({\r\n                        isOnMute: agentConnection.isMute\r\n                    });\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like the check for multi party has been removed and this method now runs far more often, including throughout normal calls.",
