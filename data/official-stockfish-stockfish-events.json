                "body": "Original idea by seer chess engine https://github.com/connormcmonigle/seer-nnue, coding done by @Disservin .\r\nThis patch introduces pawn structure based history, which assings moves values based on last digits of pawn structure hash and piece type of moved piece and landing square of the move. Idea is that good places for pieces are quite often determined by pawn structure of position.\r\nUsed in 3 different places - sorting of quiet moves, sorting of quiet check evasions and in history based pruning in search.

Especially the stat table stuff where you need a bit insight for full utilizing it. In the past (see my old pawn history stuff https://github.com/locutus2/Stockfish-old/commits/pawn_history) we had separate classes for each history, which later was refactored to have a common code base.",

Idea is that good places for pieces are quite often determined by pawn structure of position.\r\nUsed in 3 different places - sorting of quiet moves, sorting of quiet check evasions and in history based pruning in search. Can be attempted to be used in other places.\r\nPassed STC:\r\nhttps://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/65391d08cc309ae83955dbaf\r\nLLR: 2.95 (-2.94,2.94) <0.00,2.00>\r\nTotal: 155488 W: 39408 L: 38913 D: 77167\r\nPtnml(0-2): 500, 18427, 39408, 18896, 513 \r\nPassed LTC:\r\nhttps://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/653a36a2cc309ae83955f181\r\nLLR: 2.94 (-2.94,2.94) <0.50,2.50>\r\nTotal: 70110 W: 17548 L: 17155 D: 35407\r\nPtnml(0-2): 33, 7859, 18889, 8230, 44 \r\nbench 1257882",
