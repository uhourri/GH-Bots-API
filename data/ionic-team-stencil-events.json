One of the files is `components.d.ts` file which is auto-generated by stencil. We git-ignored this file and also we made slim config file only for this file to be generated and on v4.5.0 and below it works nicely, but on v4.6.0 it gives error (look at picture).\r\n\r\nScript used for dts generation: `\"build.dts\": \"stencil build --config stencil-dts.config.ts\"`\r\n`stencil-dts.config.ts`\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Config } from '@stencil/core';\r\n\r\nexport const config: Config = {\r\n  namespace: 'vnp-web-components',\r\n  sourceMap: false,\r\n  transformAliasedImportPaths: true,\r\n  outputTargets: [\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'dist-custom-elements',\r\n    },\r\n  ],\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/assets/80685558/9c296b26-c175-42a6-bcd1-e1f9a5cb9e42)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIt shouldn't give errors. If there is simpler way only to generate `component.d.ts`, please provide it. I couldn't find anything in documentation nor I found similar issue.\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nSystem: node 20.9.0\r\nPlatform: linux (6.2.0-35-generic)\r\nCPU Model: 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1265U (12 cpus)\r\nCompiler: /home/josip-kovacevic/public-www/vnp-web-components/node_modules/@stencil/core/compiler/stencil.js\r\nBuild: 1698073283\r\nStencil: 4.6.0 \ud83d\udca5\r\nTypeScript: 5.2.2\r\nRollup: 2.42.3\r\nParse5: 7.1.2\r\nSizzle: 2.42.3\r\nTerser: 5.22.0\n```\n\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nMake clean project setup using stencil cli. Try to use `build` or `start` script. It will give you TS errors since initially `components.d.ts` file does not exist.\n\n### Code Reproduction URL\n\n-\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

This would improve the developer experience of TypeScript developers.\r\n\r\nThis would also make consuming Stencil components in an Angular project with or without using the Angular build target manageable with [strictTemplates flag](https://angular.io/guide/angular-compiler-options#stricttemplates) set to true.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the Use Case\r\n\r\nThis feature would allow developers to use Stencil components in a TypeScript project where using `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` would use proper types and would eliminate the need always to use type assertion, create custom types, or overloads to each component's html element type and define them ourselves in `HTMLElementTagNameMap`.\r\n\r\nConsider the following:\r\n```tsx\r\nimport { Component, Event, EventEmitter, Prop, h } from '@stencil/core';\r\n\r\n@Component(/* ... */)\r\nexport class MyComponent {\r\n  // Add an event `example`:\r\n  @Event() example!: EventEmitter<number>;\r\n // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// HTMLMyComponentElement\r\nconst myComponent = document.createElement('my-component');\r\n\r\nmyComponent.addEventListener('example', (event) => {\r\n  // Property 'detail' does not exist on type 'Event'.ts(2339)\r\n  console.log(event.detail);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n<img width=\"1038\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-08 at 6 35 11 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/assets/9206193/f0bcb3f8-ae72-43c1-bd4c-7661ae8ea296\">\r\n\r\nThis type for the event callback shouldn't be `Event` but instead `MyComponentCustomEvent<number>`.\r\n\r\nThis issue makes working with Stencil in an Angular project very difficult since there are less options and is unclear to influence this behavior in an Angular template:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1037\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-08 at 7 17 51 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/assets/9206193/6ce42bc8-d9e8-43ee-9d64-cb00d3028192\">\r\n\r\n### Describe Preferred Solution\r\n\r\nStencil should provide types to Stencil component's html elements such that using `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` have specific types instead of just `Event`, which is typically wrong since most events are likely a `CustomEvent` of some kind.\r\n\r\nSince there are no overloads for each component's html element, they all fallback to [HTMLElement for   `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/v4.2.4/lib/lib.dom.d.ts#L6698):\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface HTMLElement {\r\n    // ...\r\n    addEventListener<K extends keyof HTMLElementEventMap>(type: K, listener: (this: HTMLElement, ev: HTMLElementEventMap[K]) => any, options?: boolean | AddEventListenerOptions): void;\r\n    addEventListener(type: string, listener: EventListenerOrEventListenerObject, options?: boolean | AddEventListenerOptions): void;\r\n    removeEventListener<K extends keyof HTMLElementEventMap>(type: K, listener: (this: HTMLElement, ev: HTMLElementEventMap[K]) => any, options?: boolean | EventListenerOptions): void;\r\n    removeEventListener(type: string, listener: EventListenerOrEventListenerObject, options?: boolean | EventListenerOptions): void;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf Stencil generated these overloads, there wouldn't be any extra steps needed to use `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n/** demo/src/components.d.ts */\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nexport interface MyComponentCustomEvent<T> extends CustomEvent<T> {\r\n    detail: T;\r\n    target: HTMLMyComponentElement;\r\n}\r\ndeclare global {\r\n    interface HTMLMyComponentElementEventMap {\r\n        example: number;\r\n    }\r\n    interface HTMLMyComponentElement extends Components.MyComponent, HTMLStencilElement {\r\n        addEventListener<K extends keyof HTMLMyComponentElementEventMap>(type: K, listener: (this: HTMLMyComponentElement, ev: MyComponentCustomEvent<HTMLMyComponentElementEventMap[K]>) => any, options?: boolean | AddEventListenerOptions): void;\r\n        addEventListener(type: string, listener: EventListenerOrEventListenerObject, options?: boolean | AddEventListenerOptions): void;\r\n        removeEventListener<K extends keyof HTMLMyComponentElementEventMap>(type: K, listener: (this: HTMLMyComponentElement, ev: MyComponentCustomEvent<HTMLMyComponentElementEventMap[K]>) => any, options?: boolean | EventListenerOptions): void;\r\n        removeEventListener(type: string, listener: EventListenerOrEventListenerObject, options?: boolean | EventListenerOptions): void;\r\n    }\r\n    var HTMLMyComponentElement: {\r\n        prototype: HTMLMyComponentElement;\r\n        new (): HTMLMyComponentElement;\r\n    };\r\n    interface HTMLElementTagNameMap {\r\n        \"my-component\": HTMLMyComponentElement;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would make dealing with events a lot easier in general:\r\n<img width=\"850\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-08 at 7 44 38 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/assets/9206193/6386f174-45d3-49f8-8a35-cbef44094bf0\">\r\n\r\nAnd especially Angular:\r\n<img width=\"973\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-08 at 7 46 18 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/assets/9206193/06ccd5d0-9021-4543-9dc3-db91ad55777e\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe Alternatives\r\n\r\nCreating a custom build target to create types that overload `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` for each Stencil component's html element type. Or add types with overloads somewhere in your project when consuming your Stencil components. Or modifying your generated `components.d.ts` through some other kind of automation.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface MyComponentCustomEvent<T> extends CustomEvent<T> {\r\n    detail: T;\r\n    target: HTMLMyComponentElement;\r\n}\r\ndeclare global {\r\n    interface HTMLMyComponentElementEventMap {\r\n        example: number;\r\n    }\r\n    interface HTMLMyComponentElement extends Components.MyComponent, HTMLStencilElement {\r\n        addEventListener<K extends keyof HTMLMyComponentElementEventMap>(type: K, listener: (this: HTMLMyComponentElement, ev: MyComponentCustomEvent<HTMLMyComponentElementEventMap[K]>) => any, options?: boolean | AddEventListenerOptions): void;\r\n        addEventListener(type: string, listener: EventListenerOrEventListenerObject, options?: boolean | AddEventListenerOptions): void;\r\n        removeEventListener<K extends keyof HTMLMyComponentElementEventMap>(type: K, listener: (this: HTMLMyComponentElement, ev: MyComponentCustomEvent<HTMLMyComponentElementEventMap[K]>) => any, options?: boolean | EventListenerOptions): void;\r\n        removeEventListener(type: string, listener: EventListenerOrEventListenerObject, options?: boolean | EventListenerOptions): void;\r\n    }\r\n    var HTMLMyComponentElement: {\r\n        prototype: HTMLMyComponentElement;\r\n        new (): HTMLMyComponentElement;\r\n    };\r\n    interface HTMLElementTagNameMap {\r\n        \"my-component\": HTMLMyComponentElement;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother workaround is to use Another workaround to this issue is this custom output target I made: https://github.com/m-thompson-code/event-listener-types-output-target#event-listener-types-output-target to automate creating event listener types.\r\n\r\n### Related Code\r\n\r\n1. Generate a stencil component library:\r\n  ```bash\r\n  npm init stencil\r\n  cd demo\r\n  ```\r\n  Choose component --> Project name: demo --> Confirm Y\r\n\r\n2. Add an event named `example` with type `EventEmitter<number>` to `MyComponent` found at `demo/src/components/my-component/my-component.tsx`:\r\n  ```tsx\r\n  // Add `Event` to import\r\n  import { Component, Event, EventEmitter, Prop, h } from '@stencil/core';\r\n  // ...\r\n  @Component(/* ... */)\r\n  export class MyComponent {\r\n    // Add an event `example`:\r\n    @Event() example!: EventEmitter<number>;\r\n   // ...\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n3. Build stencil library:\r\n  ```bash\r\n  npm run build\r\n  ```\r\n4. Add the following to any TypeScript find such as `index.ts` found at `demo/src/index.ts`:\r\n```ts\r\n// HTMLMyComponentElement\r\nconst myComponent = document.createElement('my-component');\r\n\r\n// Add event listener\r\nmyComponent.addEventListener('example', (event) => {\r\n  // Property 'detail' does not exist on type 'Event'.ts(2339)\r\n  console.log(event.detail);// <-- Type error\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen trying to access `event.detail`, this leads to a type error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProperty 'detail' does not exist on type 'Event'.ts(2339)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThis issue relates to https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-ds-output-targets/issues/219 but is not the same issue. The difference is that this issue is about Stencil as custom elements and consuming them as custom elements with or without Angular and without using the Angular output target.\r\n\r\nThat being said, a solution would likely resolve the majority of the problems involving Outputs / Events with the Angular output target.",

This would improve the developer experience of TypeScript developers.\r\n\r\nThis would also make consuming Stencil components in an Angular project with or without using the Angular build target manageable with [strictTemplates flag](https://angular.io/guide/angular-compiler-options#stricttemplates) set to true.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the Use Case\r\n\r\nThis feature would allow developers to use Stencil components in a TypeScript project where using `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` would use proper types and would eliminate the need always to use type assertion, create custom types, or overloads to each component's html element type and define them ourselves in `HTMLElementTagNameMap`.\r\n\r\nConsider the following:\r\n```tsx\r\nimport { Component, Event, EventEmitter, Prop, h } from '@stencil/core';\r\n\r\n@Component(/* ... */)\r\nexport class MyComponent {\r\n  // Add an event `example`:\r\n  @Event() example!: EventEmitter<number>;\r\n // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// HTMLMyComponentElement\r\nconst myComponent = document.createElement('my-component');\r\n\r\nmyComponent.addEventListener('example', (event) => {\r\n  // Property 'detail' does not exist on type 'Event'.ts(2339)\r\n  console.log(event.detail);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n<img width=\"1038\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-08 at 6 35 11 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/assets/9206193/f0bcb3f8-ae72-43c1-bd4c-7661ae8ea296\">\r\n\r\nThis type for the event callback shouldn't be `Event` but instead `MyComponentCustomEvent<number>`.\r\n\r\nThis issue makes working with Stencil in an Angular project very difficult since there are less options and is unclear to influence this behavior in an Angular template:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1037\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-08 at 7 17 51 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/assets/9206193/6ce42bc8-d9e8-43ee-9d64-cb00d3028192\">\r\n\r\n### Describe Preferred Solution\r\n\r\nStencil should provide types to Stencil component's html elements such that using `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` have specific types instead of just `Event`, which is typically wrong since most events are likely a `CustomEvent` of some kind.\r\n\r\nSince there are no overloads for each component's html element, they all fallback to [HTMLElement for   `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/v4.2.4/lib/lib.dom.d.ts#L6698):\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface HTMLElement {\r\n    // ...\r\n    addEventListener<K extends keyof HTMLElementEventMap>(type: K, listener: (this: HTMLElement, ev: HTMLElementEventMap[K]) => any, options?: boolean | AddEventListenerOptions): void;\r\n    addEventListener(type: string, listener: EventListenerOrEventListenerObject, options?: boolean | AddEventListenerOptions): void;\r\n    removeEventListener<K extends keyof HTMLElementEventMap>(type: K, listener: (this: HTMLElement, ev: HTMLElementEventMap[K]) => any, options?: boolean | EventListenerOptions): void;\r\n    removeEventListener(type: string, listener: EventListenerOrEventListenerObject, options?: boolean | EventListenerOptions): void;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf Stencil generated these overloads, there wouldn't be any extra steps needed to use `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n/** demo/src/components.d.ts */\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nexport interface MyComponentCustomEvent<T> extends CustomEvent<T> {\r\n    detail: T;\r\n    target: HTMLMyComponentElement;\r\n}\r\ndeclare global {\r\n    interface HTMLMyComponentElementEventMap {\r\n        example: number;\r\n    }\r\n    interface HTMLMyComponentElement extends Components.MyComponent, HTMLStencilElement {\r\n        addEventListener<K extends keyof HTMLMyComponentElementEventMap>(type: K, listener: (this: HTMLMyComponentElement, ev: MyComponentCustomEvent<HTMLMyComponentElementEventMap[K]>) => any, options?: boolean | AddEventListenerOptions): void;\r\n        addEventListener(type: string, listener: EventListenerOrEventListenerObject, options?: boolean | AddEventListenerOptions): void;\r\n        removeEventListener<K extends keyof HTMLMyComponentElementEventMap>(type: K, listener: (this: HTMLMyComponentElement, ev: MyComponentCustomEvent<HTMLMyComponentElementEventMap[K]>) => any, options?: boolean | EventListenerOptions): void;\r\n        removeEventListener(type: string, listener: EventListenerOrEventListenerObject, options?: boolean | EventListenerOptions): void;\r\n    }\r\n    var HTMLMyComponentElement: {\r\n        prototype: HTMLMyComponentElement;\r\n        new (): HTMLMyComponentElement;\r\n    };\r\n    interface HTMLElementTagNameMap {\r\n        \"my-component\": HTMLMyComponentElement;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would make dealing with events a lot easier in general:\r\n<img width=\"850\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-08 at 7 44 38 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/assets/9206193/6386f174-45d3-49f8-8a35-cbef44094bf0\">\r\n\r\nAnd especially Angular:\r\n<img width=\"973\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-08 at 7 46 18 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/assets/9206193/06ccd5d0-9021-4543-9dc3-db91ad55777e\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe Alternatives\r\n\r\nCreating a custom build target to create types that overload `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` for each Stencil component's html element type. Or add types with overloads somewhere in your project when consuming your Stencil components. Or modifying your generated `components.d.ts` through some other kind of automation.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface MyComponentCustomEvent<T> extends CustomEvent<T> {\r\n    detail: T;\r\n    target: HTMLMyComponentElement;\r\n}\r\ndeclare global {\r\n    interface HTMLMyComponentElementEventMap {\r\n        example: number;\r\n    }\r\n    interface HTMLMyComponentElement extends Components.MyComponent, HTMLStencilElement {\r\n        addEventListener<K extends keyof HTMLMyComponentElementEventMap>(type: K, listener: (this: HTMLMyComponentElement, ev: MyComponentCustomEvent<HTMLMyComponentElementEventMap[K]>) => any, options?: boolean | AddEventListenerOptions): void;\r\n        addEventListener(type: string, listener: EventListenerOrEventListenerObject, options?: boolean | AddEventListenerOptions): void;\r\n        removeEventListener<K extends keyof HTMLMyComponentElementEventMap>(type: K, listener: (this: HTMLMyComponentElement, ev: MyComponentCustomEvent<HTMLMyComponentElementEventMap[K]>) => any, options?: boolean | EventListenerOptions): void;\r\n        removeEventListener(type: string, listener: EventListenerOrEventListenerObject, options?: boolean | EventListenerOptions): void;\r\n    }\r\n    var HTMLMyComponentElement: {\r\n        prototype: HTMLMyComponentElement;\r\n        new (): HTMLMyComponentElement;\r\n    };\r\n    interface HTMLElementTagNameMap {\r\n        \"my-component\": HTMLMyComponentElement;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother workaround is to use Another workaround to this issue is this custom output target I made: https://github.com/m-thompson-code/event-listener-types-output-target#event-listener-types-output-target to automate creating event listener types.\r\n\r\n### Related Code\r\n\r\n1. Generate a stencil component library:\r\n  ```bash\r\n  npm init stencil\r\n  cd demo\r\n  ```\r\n  Choose component --> Project name: demo --> Confirm Y\r\n\r\n2. Add an event named `example` with type `EventEmitter<number>` to `MyComponent` found at `demo/src/components/my-component/my-component.tsx`:\r\n  ```tsx\r\n  // Add `Event` to import\r\n  import { Component, Event, EventEmitter, Prop, h } from '@stencil/core';\r\n  // ...\r\n  @Component(/* ... */)\r\n  export class MyComponent {\r\n    // Add an event `example`:\r\n    @Event() example!: EventEmitter<number>;\r\n   // ...\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n3. Build stencil library:\r\n  ```bash\r\n  npm run build\r\n  ```\r\n4. Add the following to any TypeScript find such as `index.ts` found at `demo/src/index.ts`:\r\n```ts\r\n// HTMLMyComponentElement\r\nconst myComponent = document.createElement('my-component');\r\n\r\n// Add event listener\r\nmyComponent.addEventListener('example', (event) => {\r\n  // Property 'detail' does not exist on type 'Event'.ts(2339)\r\n  console.log(event.detail);// <-- Type error\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen trying to access `event.detail`, this leads to a type error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProperty 'detail' does not exist on type 'Event'.ts(2339)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThis issue relates to https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-ds-output-targets/issues/219 but is not the same issue. The difference is that this issue is about Stencil as custom elements and consuming them as custom elements with or without Angular and without using the Angular output target.\r\n\r\nThat being said, a solution would likely resolve the majority of the problems involving Outputs / Events with the Angular output target.",

If (A) exports any types, this can also result in broken imports in dist/types/components.d.ts. No error is reported during build.\r\n\r\nOn second build (where there is now a src/components.d.ts present as a result of the first build), the types are generated for (A) in the output directory dist/types/components.\r\n\r\nI do not like committing auto-generated files to source control, as they result in needless churn, hence why i do not have src/components.d.ts (this was a fresh clone of my repo).\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nAll Types are present in the first compile of components.d.ts, when no components.d.ts is present in the first place.\r\n\r\nCopycat:\r\nIdeally it should Just Work(tm), and not rely on committing auto-generated files to source control. On both the first (broken) build and the second (successful) build, the src/components.d.ts file is exactly the same, so it may be a timing/ordering issue?\r\n\r\nAn alternative would simply be to raise an error in this case.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1. create new stencil project with npm init stencil\r\n2. rm src/components.d.ts\r\n3. add the components from the Related code section below\r\n4. npm run build\r\n5. open dist/types/components.d.ts and see a broken import\r\n6. ls dist/types/components/ and notice there are no types for my-other-component\r\n\r\n**Related code:**\r\nplease have a look at https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/issues/2769 ",

Regardless, the current behavior that Stencil has in this regard isn't correct, and apologies for that!\r\n> \r\n> Thanks again for reporting and sorry you're running into this issue!\r\n\r\nHi @alicewriteswrongs \r\n\r\nIs there any workaround if really needs a different dom?\r\n\r\n```\r\n propA ? <div class='scrollable aaa bbb'> <slot></slot> </div> : <slot></slot>\r\n```\r\nActuall, I don't need the `div` if the `propA` is `false`\r\n\r\n- \"@stencil/core\": \"^2.16.0\",",

This was due to logic we had for keeping relocated content in the correct order _within_ a slot executing when it shouldn't and changing our relocation node. \r\n\r\nFixes: #2997 \r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by this PR. -->\r\n\r\n- The culprit code has been wrapped in a check to only execute in certain situations that make sense (i.e. when the slot has other relocated elements)\r\n- Documented the code responsible for determining where to insert the relocated node for posterity\r\n- Cleaned up some of the code to make things more readable\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe the steps you took to test the changes in this PR.

This was due to logic we had for keeping relocated content in the correct order _within_ a slot executing when it shouldn't and changing our relocation node. \r\n\r\nFixes: #2997 \r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by this PR. -->\r\n\r\n- The culprit code has been wrapped in a check to only execute in certain situations that make sense (i.e. when the slot has other relocated elements)\r\n- Documented the code responsible for determining where to insert the relocated node for posterity\r\n- Cleaned up some of the code to make things more readable\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe the steps you took to test the changes in this PR. These steps can be programmatic (e.g. unit tests) and/or manual. -->\r\n\r\nAll existing unit and e2e tests continue to pass. Added an e2e test for the reproduction case from the linked issue\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as screenshots of how a component looks before and after the change. -->\r\n\r\nThis is only available with the `experimentalSlotFixes` extra config flag is active\r\n",

This was due to logic we had for keeping relocated content in the correct order _within_ a slot executing when it shouldn't and changing our relocation node. \r\n\r\nFixes: #2997 \r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by this PR. -->\r\n\r\n- The culprit code has been wrapped in a check to only execute in certain situations that make sense (i.e. when the slot has other relocated elements)\r\n- Documented the code responsible for determining where to insert the relocated node for posterity\r\n- Cleaned up some of the code to make things more readable\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe the steps you took to test the changes in this PR. These steps can be programmatic (e.g. unit tests) and/or manual. -->\r\n\r\nAll existing unit and e2e tests continue to pass. Added an e2e test for the reproduction case from the linked issue\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as screenshots of how a component looks before and after the change. -->\r\n\r\nThis is only available with the `experimentalSlotFixes` extra config flag is active\r\n",

This was due to logic we had for keeping relocated content in the correct order _within_ a slot executing when it shouldn't and changing our relocation node. \r\n\r\nFixes: #2997 \r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by this PR. -->\r\n\r\n- The culprit code has been wrapped in a check to only execute in certain situations that make sense (i.e. when the slot has other relocated elements)\r\n- Documented the code responsible for determining where to insert the relocated node for posterity\r\n- Cleaned up some of the code to make things more readable\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe the steps you took to test the changes in this PR. These steps can be programmatic (e.g. unit tests) and/or manual. -->\r\n\r\nAll existing unit and e2e tests continue to pass.

This was due to logic we had for keeping relocated content in the correct order _within_ a slot executing when it shouldn't and changing our relocation node. \r\n\r\nFixes: #2997 \r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by this PR. -->\r\n\r\n- The culprit code has been wrapped in a check to only execute in certain situations that make sense (i.e. when the slot has other relocated elements)\r\n- Documented the code responsible for determining where to insert the relocated node for posterity\r\n- Cleaned up some of the code to make things more readable\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe the steps you took to test the changes in this PR.

This was due to logic we had for keeping relocated content in the correct order _within_ a slot executing when it shouldn't and changing our relocation node. \r\n\r\nFixes: #2997 \r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by this PR. -->\r\n\r\n- The culprit code has been wrapped in a check to only execute in certain situations that make sense (i.e. when the slot has other relocated elements)\r\n- Documented the code responsible for determining where to insert the relocated node for posterity\r\n- Cleaned up some of the code to make things more readable\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe the steps you took to test the changes in this PR. These steps can be programmatic (e.g. unit tests) and/or manual. -->\r\n\r\nAll existing unit and e2e tests continue to pass. Added an e2e test for the reproduction case from the linked issue\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as screenshots of how a component looks before and after the change. -->\r\n\r\nThis is only available with the `experimentalSlotFixes` extra config flag is active\r\n",

This was due to logic we had for keeping relocated content in the correct order _within_ a slot executing when it shouldn't and changing our relocation node. \r\n\r\nFixes: #2997 \r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by this PR. -->\r\n\r\n- The culprit code has been wrapped in a check to only execute in certain situations that make sense (i.e. when the slot has other relocated elements)\r\n- Documented the code responsible for determining where to insert the relocated node for posterity\r\n- Cleaned up some of the code to make things more readable\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe the steps you took to test the changes in this PR. These steps can be programmatic (e.g. unit tests) and/or manual. -->\r\n\r\nAll existing unit and e2e tests continue to pass.

Currently, Stencil will not execute the logic to change slot attributes on relocated elements unless they are being relocated into a Shadow element. This was causing issues with elements receiving the `hidden` attribute when relocated because we weren't resolving the slot reference node based on the correct slot name.\r\n\r\nGitHub Issue Number: N/A\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by this PR. -->\r\n\r\nWe now perform the same slot name forwarding logic we do when moving from a non-shadow to shadow component. The `putBackInOriginalLocation` method was also updated to reset the `slot` attribute on re-relocated nodes back to their original value so relocation can work correctly on subsequent re-renders.\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe the steps you took to test the changes in this PR. These steps can be programmatic (e.g. unit tests) and/or manual. -->\r\n\r\nAll current e2e and unit tests continue to pass. Added a e2e test for the specific slot-name forwarding case this was located in.\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as screenshots of how a component looks before and after the change. -->\r\n\r\nThis behavior is only available with the `experimentalSlotFixes` extras config flag active.\r\n",

                "body": "This fixes a bug where subsequent `www` builds would not always produce working output. In particular, prior to this change a 'clean' `www` build (i.e one done after deleting all previous output) would produce a working build but subsequent builds would not.\r\n\r\nThis had to do with an optimization that Stencil attempts to do during the `www` build where it will attempt to inline the JS code for the main entry point into the `index.html` that it produces.\r\n\r\nAs part of doing this it needs to rewrite some relative paths for any module specifiers that are part of that entry point, since the HTML file is found at `www/index.html` while the JS entry point will be typically found at `www/build/project-name.js`. Thus if that entry point has an import like `import foo from './bar.js'` that will need to be rewritten to `import foo from '/build/bar.js'` in order for the import to resolve once its inlined into the HTML.\r\n\r\nThis inlining optimization was previously broken because the path rewrite code did not account for the presence of more than one instance of a given module specifier in the soon-to-be-inlined code. However, by default we have both `import` and `export` declarations in that code, so the inlined code would end up non-functional.\r\n\r\nTo give an example, the problematic excerpt of the inlined code would look typically like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport {\r\n  p as e,\r\n  b as t\r\n} from \"/build/p-71aeae62.js\";\r\nexport {\r\n  s as setNonce\r\n}\r\nfrom \"./p-71aeae62.js\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nso the first `import` declaration is being correctly rewritten to begin with `/build/` but the `export` declaration is not. The code should look like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport {\r\n  p as e,\r\n  b as t\r\n} from \"/build/p-71aeae62.js\";\r\nexport {\r\n  s as setNonce\r\n}\r\nfrom \"/build/p-71aeae62.js\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the issue by transforming all instances of a given module specifier in the text, and additionally adds a regression test that tests for this specific case.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please refer to our contributing documentation for any questions on submitting a pull request, or let us know here if you need any help: https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nYou can reproduce the issue by doing the following:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new stencil project:\r\n   ```sh\r\n   cd /tmp\r\n   npm init stencil@latest component test-www-double-build\r\n   cd test-www-double-build\r\n   npm i\r\n   ```\r\n2. Edit the `stencil.config.ts` to only do the `www` build (just for simplicity)\r\n3. build the project:\r\n   ```sh\r\n   npx stencil build\r\n   ```\r\n4. Observe that `build/index.html`. It should look something like this:\r\n   ```html\r\n   <!doctype html>\r\n   <html dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\r\n      <head>\r\n         <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n         <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=5.0\">\r\n         <title>Stencil Component Starter</title>\r\n         <script type=\"module\" src=\"/build/test-dev-build-reload.esm.js\" data-stencil data-resources-url=\"/build/\" data-stencil-namespace=\"test-dev-build-reload\"></script> <script nomodule=\"\" src=\"/build/test-dev-build-reload.js\" data-stencil>. \r\n         </script> \r\n      </head>\r\n      <body>\r\n         <my-component first=\"Stencil\" last=\"'Don't call me a framework' JS\"></my-component>\r\n      </body>\r\n   </html>\r\n   ```\r\n5. Try this build output in a browser. The easiest way is to use a simple webserver to serve the `www` directory locally, for instance:\r\n   ```sh\r\n   npx http-server www\r\n   ```\r\n   This should work with no errors in the console and the `<my-component>` tag should work properly.\r\n6. Rebuild the project _without deleting or modifying anything in `www/`_ and check out `build/index.html` again. It should now have inlined JS in the `<script>` tag, like so:\r\n   ```html\r\n   <!doctype html>\r\n   <html dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\r\n      <head>\r\n         <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n         <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=5.0\">\r\n         <title>Stencil Component Starter</title>\r\n         <script type=\"module\" data-stencil data-resources-url=\"/build/\" data-stencil-namespace=\"test-dev-build-reload\">\r\n         import{p as e,b as t}from\"/build/p-71aeae62.js\";export{s as setNonce}from\"./p-71aeae62.js\";const o=()=>{const s=import.meta.url;const t={};if(s!==\"\"){t.resourcesUrl=new URL(\".\",s).href}return e(t)};o().then((e=>t([[\"p-a9942e82\",[[1,\"my-component\",{first:[1],middle:[1],last:[1]}]]]],e)));\r\n            //# sourceMappingURL=test-dev-build-reload.esm.js.map\r\n         </script> <script nomodule=\"\" src=\"/build/test-dev-build-reload.js\" data-stencil></script> \r\n      </head>\r\n      <body>\r\n         <my-component first=\"Stencil\" last=\"'Don't call me a framework' JS\"></my-component>\r\n      </body>\r\n   </html>\r\n   ```\r\n7. Now try out this build output in the browser (as above). It should fail because the `./p-71aeae62.js` module specifier can't be resolved (it should be `/build/p-71aeae62.js` instead).\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nIf you build and install this in the same project as above you should be able to rebuild without producing a non-working build.\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nSee above. I also expanded the unit tests for this bit of code a bit.\r\n",

                "body": "This fixes a bug where subsequent `www` builds would not always produce working output. In particular, prior to this change a 'clean' `www` build (i.e one done after deleting all previous output) would produce a working build but subsequent builds would not.\r\n\r\nThis had to do with an optimization that Stencil attempts to do during the `www` build where it will attempt to inline the JS code for the main entry point into the `index.html` that it produces.\r\n\r\nAs part of doing this it needs to rewrite some relative paths for any module specifiers that are part of that entry point, since the HTML file is found at `www/index.html` while the JS entry point will be typically found at `www/build/project-name.js`. Thus if that entry point has an import like `import foo from './bar.js'` that will need to be rewritten to `import foo from '/build/bar.js'` in order for the import to resolve once its inlined into the HTML.\r\n\r\nThis inlining optimization was previously broken because the path rewrite code did not account for the presence of more than one instance of a given module specifier in the soon-to-be-inlined code. However, by default we have both `import` and `export` declarations in that code, so the inlined code would end up non-functional.\r\n\r\nTo give an example, the problematic excerpt of the inlined code would look typically like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport {\r\n  p as e,\r\n  b as t\r\n} from \"/build/p-71aeae62.js\";\r\nexport {\r\n  s as setNonce\r\n}\r\nfrom \"./p-71aeae62.js\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nso the first `import` declaration is being correctly rewritten to begin with `/build/` but the `export` declaration is not. The code should look like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport {\r\n  p as e,\r\n  b as t\r\n} from \"/build/p-71aeae62.js\";\r\nexport {\r\n  s as setNonce\r\n}\r\nfrom \"/build/p-71aeae62.js\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the issue by transforming all instances of a given module specifier in the text, and additionally adds a regression test that tests for this specific case.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please refer to our contributing documentation for any questions on submitting a pull request, or let us know here if you need any help: https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n\r\nYou can reproduce the issue by doing the following:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new stencil project:\r\n   ```sh\r\n   cd /tmp\r\n   npm init stencil@latest component test-www-double-build\r\n   cd test-www-double-build\r\n   npm i\r\n   ```\r\n2. Edit the `stencil.config.ts` to only do the `www` build (just for simplicity)\r\n3. build the project:\r\n   ```sh\r\n   npx stencil build\r\n   ```\r\n4. Observe that `build/index.html`. It should look something like this:\r\n   ```html\r\n   <!doctype html>\r\n   <html dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\r\n      <head>\r\n         <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n         <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=5.0\">\r\n         <title>Stencil Component Starter</title>\r\n         <script type=\"module\" src=\"/build/test-dev-build-reload.esm.js\" data-stencil data-resources-url=\"/build/\" data-stencil-namespace=\"test-dev-build-reload\"></script> <script nomodule=\"\" src=\"/build/test-dev-build-reload.js\" data-stencil>. \r\n         </script> \r\n      </head>\r\n      <body>\r\n         <my-component first=\"Stencil\" last=\"'Don't call me a framework' JS\"></my-component>\r\n      </body>\r\n   </html>\r\n   ```\r\n5. Try this build output in a browser. The easiest way is to use a simple webserver to serve the `www` directory locally, for instance:\r\n   ```sh\r\n   npx http-server www\r\n   ```\r\n   This should work with no errors in the console and the `<my-component>` tag should work properly.\r\n6. Rebuild the project _without deleting or modifying anything in `www/`_ and check out `build/index.html` again. It should now have inlined JS in the `<script>` tag, like so:\r\n   ```html\r\n   <!doctype html>\r\n   <html dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\r\n      <head>\r\n         <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n         <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=5.0\">\r\n         <title>Stencil Component Starter</title>\r\n         <script type=\"module\" data-stencil data-resources-url=\"/build/\" data-stencil-namespace=\"test-dev-build-reload\">\r\n         import{p as e,b as t}from\"/build/p-71aeae62.js\";export{s as setNonce}from\"./p-71aeae62.js\";const o=()=>{const s=import.meta.url;const t={};if(s!==\"\"){t.resourcesUrl=new URL(\".\",s).href}return e(t)};o().then((e=>t([[\"p-a9942e82\",[[1,\"my-component\",{first:[1],middle:[1],last:[1]}]]]],e)));\r\n            //# sourceMappingURL=test-dev-build-reload.esm.js.map\r\n         </script> <script nomodule=\"\" src=\"/build/test-dev-build-reload.js\" data-stencil></script> \r\n      </head>\r\n      <body>\r\n         <my-component first=\"Stencil\" last=\"'Don't call me a framework' JS\"></my-component>\r\n      </body>\r\n   </html>\r\n   ```\r\n7. Now try out this build output in the browser (as above). It should fail because the `./p-71aeae62.js` module specifier can't be resolved (it should be `/build/p-71aeae62.js` instead).\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nIf you build and install this in the same project as above you should be able to rebuild without producing a non-working build.\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nSee above. I also expanded the unit tests for this bit of code a bit.\r\n",

I'll probably wait until both are approved to begin the merging/squashing/rebasing of the two branches \r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by this PR. -->\r\nAdd support for Jest 29 to Stencil\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nTo test, I generated a dev build of the branch - `@stencil/core@4.6.0-dev.1698239124.bd2fbc0`\r\n- [Dev Release Workflow](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/actions/runs/6640809983)\r\n- [NPM Registry Entry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stencil/core/v/4.6.0-dev.1698239124.bd2fbc0)\r\n\r\n### Component Starter Testing\r\n\r\nI tested this on a Stencil Component Starter (manually).\r\n\r\nI started by generating a new project with the dev build:\r\n```bash\r\ncd /tmp \\\r\n&& npm init stencil@latest component jest-test \\\r\n&& cd $_ \\\r\n&& npm i @stencil/core@4.6.0-dev.1698239124.bd2fbc0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen installed each version of jest and tested them:\r\n```bash\r\nnpm i jest@24 jest-cli@24 @types/jest@24 && npm t -- --no-cache && \\\r\nnpm i jest@25 jest-cli@25 @types/jest@25 && npm t -- --no-cache && \\\r\nnpm i jest@26 jest-cli@26 @types/jest@26 && npm t -- --no-cache && \\\r\nnpm i jest@27 jest-cli@27 @types/jest@27 && npm t -- --no-cache && \\\r\nnpm i jest@28 jest-cli@28 @types/jest@28 && npm t -- --no-cache && \\\r\nnpm i jest@29 jest-cli@29 @types/jest@29 && npm t -- --no-cache\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Ionic Framework\r\n\r\nI tested this branch in the Ionic Framework as well.\r\n\r\nNote: Node 18 is required to run tests here. \r\n\r\n1. Pull the latest Ionic Framework code, check out `main`\r\n2. `cd core/ && npm i @stencil/core@4.6.0-dev.1698239124.bd2fbc0`\r\n3. `npm i jest@29 @types/jest@29 jest-cli@29 @jest/core@29`\r\n4. `npm run test.spec -- --no-cache`\r\n5. At this point, an error should appear \r\n6. Apply the following patch:\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/core/src/components/datetime/test/data.spec.ts b/core/src/components/datetime/test/data.spec.ts\r\nindex 4484224402..0306d09f9c 100644\r\n--- a/core/src/components/datetime/test/data.spec.ts\r\n+++ b/core/src/components/datetime/test/data.spec.ts\r\n@@ -482,7 +482,7 @@ describe('generateTime()', () => {\r\n \r\n describe('getToday', () => {\r\n   beforeAll(() => {\r\n-    jest.useFakeTimers('modern');\r\n+    jest.useFakeTimers();\r\n```\r\n7. Rerun the tests, everything ought to pass now \ud83d\udc4d \r\n<!-- Please describe the steps you took to test the changes in this PR.
