At least as long as there is no comprehensive config helper as we have it for _Taranis_ (which is just great).\r\n\r\nThx for thinking about it :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

                "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nI have a Taranis X9D+ SE 2019 (openTX 2.3.14) and an iRangeX IRX4+ multimodule (firmware 1.3.6)\r\nI'm facing a fairly critical issue of communication cut off between radio and module.\r\n\r\nIn serial mode (MULTI), communication between the radio and the multimodule cuts off under reproducible circumstances as follows :\r\n- radio is using external RF \r\n- communication between radio and module is set in serial mode (MULTI)\r\n- receiver doesn't need to be on (though problem may appear quicker when receiver is on, but not sure of this point)\r\n- after several toggles of the 2-positions switch SF (random number of toggles, that can be one or ten, rarely more than a few tens) the communication between the radio and the multimodule cuts off (the radio says \"No serial input\" and the red led flashes slowly on the multimodule)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9478418/143895294-a130a1f3-ba6e-49ca-9fd3-125d161386b2.png)\r\n\r\nI posted this issue to RC Groups thread and it appears that this is not an isolated case, it seems to be related to using multimodule inside X9D+ SE 2019, please [see here](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=48240461&postcount=23142).\r\n\r\n[Old openTX versions](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=48249615&postcount=23150) for X9D+ SE 2019 have been posted on the same thread so I could try and see if issue is still there.\r\n\r\nHere are the results of my tests : \r\n- openTX 2.3.13 : issue is present\r\n- openTX 2.3.12 : issue is present\r\n- openTX 2.3.11 : no issue detected\r\n- openTX 2.3.10 : no issue detected\r\n- openTX <= 2.3.9 : not tested\r\n\r\nSo it seems to me that the issue appeared with openTX 2.3.12 and is there since.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help. Best regards.\r\n\r\nRemark : no issue with another switch than SF, no issue with PPM communication mode, no issue with SF switch when using internal RF, no issue with an X9D, seems specific to X9D+ SE 2019 + multimodule + serial mode + SF switch",

Instead of a distance, like e.g. 312m, suddenly I have like \r\n12371m or 20629m displayed. Just some strange value which probably occured due to a transmission failure. And now such a value makes it into Maximum/Minimum scores and as well into the logs.\r\nAnd all happens while the telemetry basically continue to work fine, including GPS distances.\r\n\r\nIn reality it will never happen that a reasonable distance change is more than a couple of 10m among a measurement period. OTX may can check whether a telemetry value makes sense at all and may even in comparison to the last value(s). If a value is not sensefull, it can simple be dropped and does not pollute logs and statistics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Best regards.\r\n\r\nRemark : no issue with another switch than SF, no issue with PPM communication mode, no issue with SF switch when using internal RF, no issue with an X9D, seems specific to X9D+ SE 2019 + multimodule + serial mode + SF switch",

Instead of a distance, like e.g. 312m, suddenly I have like \r\n12371m or 20629m displayed. Just some strange value which probably occured due to a transmission failure. And now such a value makes it into Maximum/Minimum scores and as well into the logs.\r\nAnd all happens while the telemetry basically continue to work fine, including GPS distances.\r\n\r\nIn reality it will never happen that a reasonable distance change is more than a couple of 10m among a measurement period. OTX may can check whether a telemetry value makes sense at all and may even in comparison to the last value(s). If a value is not sensefull, it can simple be dropped and does not pollute logs and statistics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

                "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nI have a Taranis X9D+ SE 2019 (openTX 2.3.14) and an iRangeX IRX4+ multimodule (firmware 1.3.6)\r\nI'm facing a fairly critical issue of communication cut off between radio and module.\r\n\r\nIn serial mode (MULTI), communication between the radio and the multimodule cuts off under reproducible circumstances as follows :\r\n- radio is using external RF \r\n- communication between radio and module is set in serial mode (MULTI)\r\n- receiver doesn't need to be on (though problem may appear quicker when receiver is on, but not sure of this point)\r\n- after several toggles of the 2-positions switch SF (random number of toggles, that can be one or ten, rarely more than a few tens) the communication between the radio and the multimodule cuts off (the radio says \"No serial input\" and the red led flashes slowly on the multimodule)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9478418/143895294-a130a1f3-ba6e-49ca-9fd3-125d161386b2.png)\r\n\r\nI posted this issue to RC Groups thread and it appears that this is not an isolated case, it seems to be related to using multimodule inside X9D+ SE 2019, please [see here](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=48240461&postcount=23142).\r\n\r\n[Old openTX versions](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=48249615&postcount=23150) for X9D+ SE 2019 have been posted on the same thread so I could try and see if issue is still there.\r\n\r\nHere are the results of my tests : \r\n- openTX 2.3.13 : issue is present\r\n- openTX 2.3.12 : issue is present\r\n- openTX 2.3.11 : no issue detected\r\n- openTX 2.3.10 : no issue detected\r\n- openTX <= 2.3.9 : not tested\r\n\r\nSo it seems to me that the issue appeared with openTX 2.3.12 and is there since.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help. Best regards.\r\n\r\nRemark : no issue with another switch than SF, no issue with PPM communication mode, no issue with SF switch when using internal RF, no issue with an X9D, seems specific to X9D+ SE 2019 + multimodule + serial mode + SF switch",

                "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nI have a Taranis X9D+ SE 2019 (openTX 2.3.14) and an iRangeX IRX4+ multimodule (firmware 1.3.6)\r\nI'm facing a fairly critical issue of communication cut off between radio and module.\r\n\r\nIn serial mode (MULTI), communication between the radio and the multimodule cuts off under reproducible circumstances as follows :\r\n- radio is using external RF \r\n- communication between radio and module is set in serial mode (MULTI)\r\n- receiver doesn't need to be on (though problem may appear quicker when receiver is on, but not sure of this point)\r\n- after several toggles of the 2-positions switch SF (random number of toggles, that can be one or ten, rarely more than a few tens) the communication between the radio and the multimodule cuts off (the radio says \"No serial input\" and the red led flashes slowly on the multimodule)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9478418/143895294-a130a1f3-ba6e-49ca-9fd3-125d161386b2.png)\r\n\r\nI posted this issue to RC Groups thread and it appears that this is not an isolated case, it seems to be related to using multimodule inside X9D+ SE 2019, please [see here](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=48240461&postcount=23142).\r\n\r\n[Old openTX versions](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=48249615&postcount=23150) for X9D+ SE 2019 have been posted on the same thread so I could try and see if issue is still there.\r\n\r\nHere are the results of my tests : \r\n- openTX 2.3.13 : issue is present\r\n- openTX 2.3.12 : issue is present\r\n- openTX 2.3.11 : no issue detected\r\n- openTX 2.3.10 : no issue detected\r\n- openTX <= 2.3.9 : not tested\r\n\r\nSo it seems to me that the issue appeared with openTX 2.3.12 and is there since.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help. Best regards.\r\n\r\nRemark : no issue with another switch than SF, no issue with PPM communication mode, no issue with SF switch when using internal RF, no issue with an X9D, seems specific to X9D+ SE 2019 + multimodule + serial mode + SF switch",

Best regards.\r\n\r\nRemark : no issue with another switch than SF, no issue with PPM communication mode, no issue with SF switch when using internal RF, no issue with an X9D, seems specific to X9D+ SE 2019 + multimodule + serial mode + SF switch",

                "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nI have a Taranis X9D+ SE 2019 (openTX 2.3.14) and an iRangeX IRX4+ multimodule (firmware 1.3.6)\r\nI'm facing a fairly critical issue of communication cut off between radio and module.\r\n\r\nIn serial mode (MULTI), communication between the radio and the multimodule cuts off under reproducible circumstances as follows :\r\n- radio is using external RF \r\n- communication between radio and module is set in serial mode (MULTI)\r\n- receiver doesn't need to be on (though problem may appear quicker when receiver is on, but not sure of this point)\r\n- after several toggles of the 2-positions switch SF (random number of toggles, that can be one or ten, rarely more than a few tens) the communication between the radio and the multimodule cuts off (the radio says \"No serial input\" and the red led flashes slowly on the multimodule)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9478418/143895294-a130a1f3-ba6e-49ca-9fd3-125d161386b2.png)\r\n\r\nI posted this issue to RC Groups thread and it appears that this is not an isolated case, it seems to be related to using multimodule inside X9D+ SE 2019, please [see here](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=48240461&postcount=23142).\r\n\r\n[Old openTX versions](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=48249615&postcount=23150) for X9D+ SE 2019 have been posted on the same thread so I could try and see if issue is still there.\r\n\r\nHere are the results of my tests : \r\n- openTX 2.3.13 : issue is present\r\n- openTX 2.3.12 : issue is present\r\n- openTX 2.3.11 : no issue detected\r\n- openTX 2.3.10 : no issue detected\r\n- openTX <= 2.3.9 : not tested\r\n\r\nSo it seems to me that the issue appeared with openTX 2.3.12 and is there since.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help. Best regards.\r\n\r\nRemark : no issue with another switch than SF, no issue with PPM communication mode, no issue with SF switch when using internal RF, no issue with an X9D, seems specific to X9D+ SE 2019 + multimodule + serial mode + SF switch",

                "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nI have a Taranis X9D+ SE 2019 (openTX 2.3.14) and an iRangeX IRX4+ multimodule (firmware 1.3.6)\r\nI'm facing a fairly critical issue of communication cut off between radio and module.\r\n\r\nIn serial mode (MULTI), communication between the radio and the multimodule cuts off under reproducible circumstances as follows :\r\n- radio is using external RF \r\n- communication between radio and module is set in serial mode (MULTI)\r\n- receiver doesn't need to be on (though problem may appear quicker when receiver is on, but not sure of this point)\r\n- after several toggles of the 2-positions switch SF (random number of toggles, that can be one or ten, rarely more than a few tens) the communication between the radio and the multimodule cuts off (the radio says \"No serial input\" and the red led flashes slowly on the multimodule)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9478418/143895294-a130a1f3-ba6e-49ca-9fd3-125d161386b2.png)\r\n\r\nI posted this issue to RC Groups thread and it appears that this is not an isolated case, it seems to be related to using multimodule inside X9D+ SE 2019, please [see here](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=48240461&postcount=23142).\r\n\r\n[Old openTX versions](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=48249615&postcount=23150) for X9D+ SE 2019 have been posted on the same thread so I could try and see if issue is still there.\r\n\r\nHere are the results of my tests : \r\n- openTX 2.3.13 : issue is present\r\n- openTX 2.3.12 : issue is present\r\n- openTX 2.3.11 : no issue detected\r\n- openTX 2.3.10 : no issue detected\r\n- openTX <= 2.3.9 : not tested\r\n\r\nSo it seems to me that the issue appeared with openTX 2.3.12 and is there since.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help. Best regards.\r\n\r\nRemark : no issue with another switch than SF, no issue with PPM communication mode, no issue with SF switch when using internal RF, no issue with an X9D, seems specific to X9D+ SE 2019 + multimodule + serial mode + SF switch",

                "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nI have a Taranis X9D+ SE 2019 (openTX 2.3.14) and an iRangeX IRX4+ multimodule (firmware 1.3.6)\r\nI'm facing a fairly critical issue of communication cut off between radio and module.\r\n\r\nIn serial mode (MULTI), communication between the radio and the multimodule cuts off under reproducible circumstances as follows :\r\n- radio is using external RF \r\n- communication between radio and module is set in serial mode (MULTI)\r\n- receiver doesn't need to be on (though problem may appear quicker when receiver is on, but not sure of this point)\r\n- after several toggles of the 2-positions switch SF (random number of toggles, that can be one or ten, rarely more than a few tens) the communication between the radio and the multimodule cuts off (the radio says \"No serial input\" and the red led flashes slowly on the multimodule)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9478418/143895294-a130a1f3-ba6e-49ca-9fd3-125d161386b2.png)\r\n\r\nI posted this issue to RC Groups thread and it appears that this is not an isolated case, it seems to be related to using multimodule inside X9D+ SE 2019, please [see here](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=48240461&postcount=23142).\r\n\r\n[Old openTX versions](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=48249615&postcount=23150) for X9D+ SE 2019 have been posted on the same thread so I could try and see if issue is still there.\r\n\r\nHere are the results of my tests : \r\n- openTX 2.3.13 : issue is present\r\n- openTX 2.3.12 : issue is present\r\n- openTX 2.3.11 : no issue detected\r\n- openTX 2.3.10 : no issue detected\r\n- openTX <= 2.3.9 : not tested\r\n\r\nSo it seems to me that the issue appeared with openTX 2.3.12 and is there since.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help. Best regards.\r\n\r\nRemark : no issue with another switch than SF, no issue with PPM communication mode, no issue with SF switch when using internal RF, no issue with an X9D, seems specific to X9D+ SE 2019 + multimodule + serial mode + SF switch",
