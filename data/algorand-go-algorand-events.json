                "body": "## Status\r\n\r\nThere is no way to get Windows binaries from Algorand Inc or Foundation. If someone comes to use asking for Windows binaries, we point them to third parties or tell them to build from source. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Developers\r\n\r\nRight now docker is required for building on Algorand because of the need to run a localnet. This adds a significant amount of friction to the Algorand developer experience because some people might not already have docker installed. This is problematic particularly on Windows because it requires WSL to be installed as well. This has resulted in many hours of devrel time debugging Microsoft's software that we have no control over. It's also a non-trivial download for those in areas with poor internet connectivity.\r\n\r\nOn MacOS, docker is also not a light process because it requires a VM to be running the background. I personally have had issues with Docker daemon on Mac and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Most of the time a simple force quite solves the problem, but still annoying. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Node Runners\r\n\r\nRight now there are multiple third parties distributing binaries and node runners have to choose one to trust. Not only do they have to trust that there aren't any malicious code injections, but they also have to trust that the third party will continue to release binaries as there are new consensus updates. This is even more important once we get mining incentives.\r\n\r\n### Problems for Algorand\r\n\r\nBecause we are forcing people to use third party binaries, if problems were to ever arise with one of these binaries Algorand as a network and likely Inc/Foundation as entities would get blamed. \"Algorand node software compromised with malware\" is not a good headline for the perception of the network, regardless of who is actually responsible. While this situation may seem unlikely, take a look at MyAlgo and how many people still believe that this was a problem with Algorand and/or the Foundation.\r\n\r\n## Expected\r\n\r\nThere should be a way, even if not officially supported, for developers and node runners to acquire `go-algorand` binaries without having to go through a third party. This offers benefits for two separate groups of people.\r\n\r\n ## Solution\r\n\r\nI see a couple of solutions as a reasonable path forward:\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in `go-algorand` releases\r\n\r\nFor every software release, a `UNSUPPORTED_node_stable_win-amd64_3.19.0.tar.gz` tarball could be released\r\n\r\nThis to me is the most preferable option.\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in non-stable builds\r\n\r\nIn non-stable (or perhaps only nightly) builds include Windows binaries, but not in stable releases. This, however, increases the likelihood of someone trying to run future releases on mainnet. \r\n\r\n### Foundation builds Windows binaries\r\n\r\nIf the Inc does not want to release binaries, the Foundation could have a seperate pipeline specifically for Windows builds that are not officially supported. \r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nRequires modification to the release workflows of `go-algorand` or build server infra for the Foundation\r\n\r\n## Urgency\r\n\r\nMedium? See aforementioned problems. ",

This offers benefits for two separate groups of people.\r\n\r\n ## Solution\r\n\r\nI see a couple of solutions as a reasonable path forward:\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in `go-algorand` releases\r\n\r\nFor every software release, a `UNSUPPORTED_node_stable_win-amd64_3.19.0.tar.gz` tarball could be released\r\n\r\nThis to me is the most preferable option.\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in non-stable builds\r\n\r\nIn non-stable (or perhaps only nightly) builds include Windows binaries, but not in stable releases. This, however, increases the likelihood of someone trying to run future releases on mainnet. \r\n\r\n### Foundation builds Windows binaries\r\n\r\nIf the Inc does not want to release binaries, the Foundation could have a seperate pipeline specifically for Windows builds that are not officially supported. \r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nRequires modification to the release workflows of `go-algorand` or build server infra for the Foundation\r\n\r\n## Urgency\r\n\r\nMedium?

If someone comes to use asking for Windows binaries, we point them to third parties or tell them to build from source. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Developers\r\n\r\nRight now docker is required for building on Algorand because of the need to run a localnet. This adds a significant amount of friction to the Algorand developer experience because some people might not already have docker installed. This is problematic particularly on Windows because it requires WSL to be installed as well. This has resulted in many hours of devrel time debugging Microsoft's software that we have no control over. It's also a non-trivial download for those in areas with poor internet connectivity.\r\n\r\nOn MacOS, docker is also not a light process because it requires a VM to be running the background. I personally have had issues with Docker daemon on Mac and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Most of the time a simple force quite solves the problem, but still annoying. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Node Runners\r\n\r\nRight now there are multiple third parties distributing binaries and node runners have to choose one to trust. Not only do they have to trust that there aren't any malicious code injections, but they also have to trust that the third party will continue to release binaries as there are new consensus updates.

What we need to help drive adoption through experimentation with Algorand as an artifact in software designs is a quick, one click install user experience, with corresponding docs and guidance on the developer portal that we can refer to when developing our own educational materials.",

                "body": "## Status\r\n\r\nThere is no way to get Windows binaries from Algorand Inc or Foundation. If someone comes to use asking for Windows binaries, we point them to third parties or tell them to build from source. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Developers\r\n\r\nRight now docker is required for building on Algorand because of the need to run a localnet. This adds a significant amount of friction to the Algorand developer experience because some people might not already have docker installed. This is problematic particularly on Windows because it requires WSL to be installed as well. This has resulted in many hours of devrel time debugging Microsoft's software that we have no control over. It's also a non-trivial download for those in areas with poor internet connectivity.\r\n\r\nOn MacOS, docker is also not a light process because it requires a VM to be running the background. I personally have had issues with Docker daemon on Mac and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Most of the time a simple force quite solves the problem, but still annoying. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Node Runners\r\n\r\nRight now there are multiple third parties distributing binaries and node runners have to choose one to trust. Not only do they have to trust that there aren't any malicious code injections, but they also have to trust that the third party will continue to release binaries as there are new consensus updates. This is even more important once we get mining incentives.\r\n\r\n### Problems for Algorand\r\n\r\nBecause we are forcing people to use third party binaries, if problems were to ever arise with one of these binaries Algorand as a network and likely Inc/Foundation as entities would get blamed. \"Algorand node software compromised with malware\" is not a good headline for the perception of the network, regardless of who is actually responsible. While this situation may seem unlikely, take a look at MyAlgo and how many people still believe that this was a problem with Algorand and/or the Foundation.\r\n\r\n## Expected\r\n\r\nThere should be a way, even if not officially supported, for developers and node runners to acquire `go-algorand` binaries without having to go through a third party. This offers benefits for two separate groups of people.\r\n\r\n ## Solution\r\n\r\nI see a couple of solutions as a reasonable path forward:\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in `go-algorand` releases\r\n\r\nFor every software release, a `UNSUPPORTED_node_stable_win-amd64_3.19.0.tar.gz` tarball could be released\r\n\r\nThis to me is the most preferable option.\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in non-stable builds\r\n\r\nIn non-stable (or perhaps only nightly) builds include Windows binaries, but not in stable releases. This, however, increases the likelihood of someone trying to run future releases on mainnet. \r\n\r\n### Foundation builds Windows binaries\r\n\r\nIf the Inc does not want to release binaries, the Foundation could have a seperate pipeline specifically for Windows builds that are not officially supported. \r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nRequires modification to the release workflows of `go-algorand` or build server infra for the Foundation\r\n\r\n## Urgency\r\n\r\nMedium? See aforementioned problems. ",

I'm responsible for about a dozen of those keys, most of them are actually participating. :)  And thanks for the latest update that lets us choose the data directory!\r\n\r\n@Curtis-D I'm running AustP's binaries on Win 11 Pro.   I also run BTC, XCH, and XMR nodes in Windows. Yea, there's downtime with automatic updates enabled. A few minutes once in a while, like every few months maybe.  Most updates don't require reboot. If it does, the system reboots & the node self-starts.  \r\n\r\nWhile I think it's safe to assume the \"non-technical\" (read WINDOWS) user doesn't know how to debug and compile code or know Linux doesn't mean that we can assume that they don't have at least some level of tech prowess and would probably at least let it run 24/7.  Automatic updates/reboot can be disabled too, it doesn't take a developer to figure out how to turn them off. \r\n\r\nAnyway, gatekeeping who can run a node because some people don't want to learn a new OS or debug and compile code isn't helpful.  If we want adoption, an idiot proof installer is what the foundation should be shooting for.  Crypto for the masses, not just the highly tech literate.",

                "body": "## Status\r\n\r\nThere is no way to get Windows binaries from Algorand Inc or Foundation. If someone comes to use asking for Windows binaries, we point them to third parties or tell them to build from source. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Developers\r\n\r\nRight now docker is required for building on Algorand because of the need to run a localnet. This adds a significant amount of friction to the Algorand developer experience because some people might not already have docker installed. This is problematic particularly on Windows because it requires WSL to be installed as well. This has resulted in many hours of devrel time debugging Microsoft's software that we have no control over. It's also a non-trivial download for those in areas with poor internet connectivity.\r\n\r\nOn MacOS, docker is also not a light process because it requires a VM to be running the background. I personally have had issues with Docker daemon on Mac and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Most of the time a simple force quite solves the problem, but still annoying. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Node Runners\r\n\r\nRight now there are multiple third parties distributing binaries and node runners have to choose one to trust. Not only do they have to trust that there aren't any malicious code injections, but they also have to trust that the third party will continue to release binaries as there are new consensus updates. This is even more important once we get mining incentives.\r\n\r\n### Problems for Algorand\r\n\r\nBecause we are forcing people to use third party binaries, if problems were to ever arise with one of these binaries Algorand as a network and likely Inc/Foundation as entities would get blamed. \"Algorand node software compromised with malware\" is not a good headline for the perception of the network, regardless of who is actually responsible. While this situation may seem unlikely, take a look at MyAlgo and how many people still believe that this was a problem with Algorand and/or the Foundation.\r\n\r\n## Expected\r\n\r\nThere should be a way, even if not officially supported, for developers and node runners to acquire `go-algorand` binaries without having to go through a third party. This offers benefits for two separate groups of people.\r\n\r\n ## Solution\r\n\r\nI see a couple of solutions as a reasonable path forward:\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in `go-algorand` releases\r\n\r\nFor every software release, a `UNSUPPORTED_node_stable_win-amd64_3.19.0.tar.gz` tarball could be released\r\n\r\nThis to me is the most preferable option.\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in non-stable builds\r\n\r\nIn non-stable (or perhaps only nightly) builds include Windows binaries, but not in stable releases. This, however, increases the likelihood of someone trying to run future releases on mainnet. \r\n\r\n### Foundation builds Windows binaries\r\n\r\nIf the Inc does not want to release binaries, the Foundation could have a seperate pipeline specifically for Windows builds that are not officially supported. \r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nRequires modification to the release workflows of `go-algorand` or build server infra for the Foundation\r\n\r\n## Urgency\r\n\r\nMedium? See aforementioned problems. ",

It's essentially going to be sending out a heartbeat and stop them being suspended (even more so if their stake is lower)\r\n> \r\n> I don't want to get to deep into this here because I think this is not a problem unique to Windows, thus the need for the heartbeat in the first place. But I think some probability of downtime and VRF overlap is acceptable. There also could be a supplemental mechanism to the node that monitors uptime and the heartbeat only gets sent out if the node has been up throughout its unlucky period.\r\n\r\nIt's not unique to Windows but is going to happen significantly more on Windows than on a Linux machine that is more often than not running server grade OS. Anyway, I agree, probably more important stuff to discuss here",

                "body": "## Status\r\n\r\nThere is no way to get Windows binaries from Algorand Inc or Foundation. If someone comes to use asking for Windows binaries, we point them to third parties or tell them to build from source. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Developers\r\n\r\nRight now docker is required for building on Algorand because of the need to run a localnet. This adds a significant amount of friction to the Algorand developer experience because some people might not already have docker installed. This is problematic particularly on Windows because it requires WSL to be installed as well. This has resulted in many hours of devrel time debugging Microsoft's software that we have no control over. It's also a non-trivial download for those in areas with poor internet connectivity.\r\n\r\nOn MacOS, docker is also not a light process because it requires a VM to be running the background. I personally have had issues with Docker daemon on Mac and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Most of the time a simple force quite solves the problem, but still annoying. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Node Runners\r\n\r\nRight now there are multiple third parties distributing binaries and node runners have to choose one to trust. Not only do they have to trust that there aren't any malicious code injections, but they also have to trust that the third party will continue to release binaries as there are new consensus updates. This is even more important once we get mining incentives.\r\n\r\n### Problems for Algorand\r\n\r\nBecause we are forcing people to use third party binaries, if problems were to ever arise with one of these binaries Algorand as a network and likely Inc/Foundation as entities would get blamed. \"Algorand node software compromised with malware\" is not a good headline for the perception of the network, regardless of who is actually responsible. While this situation may seem unlikely, take a look at MyAlgo and how many people still believe that this was a problem with Algorand and/or the Foundation.\r\n\r\n## Expected\r\n\r\nThere should be a way, even if not officially supported, for developers and node runners to acquire `go-algorand` binaries without having to go through a third party. This offers benefits for two separate groups of people.\r\n\r\n ## Solution\r\n\r\nI see a couple of solutions as a reasonable path forward:\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in `go-algorand` releases\r\n\r\nFor every software release, a `UNSUPPORTED_node_stable_win-amd64_3.19.0.tar.gz` tarball could be released\r\n\r\nThis to me is the most preferable option.\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in non-stable builds\r\n\r\nIn non-stable (or perhaps only nightly) builds include Windows binaries, but not in stable releases. This, however, increases the likelihood of someone trying to run future releases on mainnet. \r\n\r\n### Foundation builds Windows binaries\r\n\r\nIf the Inc does not want to release binaries, the Foundation could have a seperate pipeline specifically for Windows builds that are not officially supported. \r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nRequires modification to the release workflows of `go-algorand` or build server infra for the Foundation\r\n\r\n## Urgency\r\n\r\nMedium? See aforementioned problems. ",

It's essentially going to be sending out a heartbeat and stop them being suspended (even more so if their stake is lower)\r\n\r\nI don't want to get to deep into this here because I think this is not a problem unique to Windows, thus the need for the heartbeat in the first place. But I think some probability of downtime and VRF overlap is acceptable. There also could be a supplemental mechanism to the node that monitors uptime and the heartbeat only gets sent out if the node has been up throughout its unlucky period.",

If someone comes to use asking for Windows binaries, we point them to third parties or tell them to build from source. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Developers\r\n\r\nRight now docker is required for building on Algorand because of the need to run a localnet. This adds a significant amount of friction to the Algorand developer experience because some people might not already have docker installed. This is problematic particularly on Windows because it requires WSL to be installed as well. This has resulted in many hours of devrel time debugging Microsoft's software that we have no control over. It's also a non-trivial download for those in areas with poor internet connectivity.\r\n\r\nOn MacOS, docker is also not a light process because it requires a VM to be running the background. I personally have had issues with Docker daemon on Mac and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Most of the time a simple force quite solves the problem, but still annoying. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Node Runners\r\n\r\nRight now there are multiple third parties distributing binaries and node runners have to choose one to trust. Not only do they have to trust that there aren't any malicious code injections, but they also have to trust that the third party will continue to release binaries as there are new consensus updates. This is even more important once we get mining incentives.\r\n\r\n### Problems for Algorand\r\n\r\nBecause we are forcing people to use third party binaries, if problems were to ever arise with one of these binaries Algorand as a network and likely Inc/Foundation as entities would get blamed. \"Algorand node software compromised with malware\" is not a good headline for the perception of the network, regardless of who is actually responsible. While this situation may seem unlikely, take a look at MyAlgo and how many people still believe that this was a problem with Algorand and/or the Foundation.\r\n\r\n## Expected\r\n\r\nThere should be a way, even if not officially supported, for developers and node runners to acquire `go-algorand` binaries without having to go through a third party. This offers benefits for two separate groups of people.\r\n\r\n ## Solution\r\n\r\nI see a couple of solutions as a reasonable path forward:\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in `go-algorand` releases\r\n\r\nFor every software release, a `UNSUPPORTED_node_stable_win-amd64_3.19.0.tar.gz` tarball could be released\r\n\r\nThis to me is the most preferable option.\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in non-stable builds\r\n\r\nIn non-stable (or perhaps only nightly) builds include Windows binaries, but not in stable releases. This, however, increases the likelihood of someone trying to run future releases on mainnet. \r\n\r\n### Foundation builds Windows binaries\r\n\r\nIf the Inc does not want to release binaries, the Foundation could have a seperate pipeline specifically for Windows builds that are not officially supported. \r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nRequires modification to the release workflows of `go-algorand` or build server infra for the Foundation\r\n\r\n## Urgency\r\n\r\nMedium?

Perhaps if liability is really the concern here and Inc + Foundation are unable to provide the binaries, then the `go-algorand` source should be modified to prevent build/run on Windows. This forces any native windows binaries to not only be seperate binaries, but seperate source as well. This of course would require an open source fork to be maintained by a third party, but at least then it'd be easier for users to audit the forks CD pipeline and get the binaries from GitHub",

                "body": "## Status\r\n\r\nThere is no way to get Windows binaries from Algorand Inc or Foundation. If someone comes to use asking for Windows binaries, we point them to third parties or tell them to build from source. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Developers\r\n\r\nRight now docker is required for building on Algorand because of the need to run a localnet. This adds a significant amount of friction to the Algorand developer experience because some people might not already have docker installed. This is problematic particularly on Windows because it requires WSL to be installed as well. This has resulted in many hours of devrel time debugging Microsoft's software that we have no control over. It's also a non-trivial download for those in areas with poor internet connectivity.\r\n\r\nOn MacOS, docker is also not a light process because it requires a VM to be running the background. I personally have had issues with Docker daemon on Mac and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Most of the time a simple force quite solves the problem, but still annoying. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Node Runners\r\n\r\nRight now there are multiple third parties distributing binaries and node runners have to choose one to trust. Not only do they have to trust that there aren't any malicious code injections, but they also have to trust that the third party will continue to release binaries as there are new consensus updates. This is even more important once we get mining incentives.\r\n\r\n### Problems for Algorand\r\n\r\nBecause we are forcing people to use third party binaries, if problems were to ever arise with one of these binaries Algorand as a network and likely Inc/Foundation as entities would get blamed. \"Algorand node software compromised with malware\" is not a good headline for the perception of the network, regardless of who is actually responsible. While this situation may seem unlikely, take a look at MyAlgo and how many people still believe that this was a problem with Algorand and/or the Foundation.\r\n\r\n## Expected\r\n\r\nThere should be a way, even if not officially supported, for developers and node runners to acquire `go-algorand` binaries without having to go through a third party. This offers benefits for two separate groups of people.\r\n\r\n ## Solution\r\n\r\nI see a couple of solutions as a reasonable path forward:\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in `go-algorand` releases\r\n\r\nFor every software release, a `UNSUPPORTED_node_stable_win-amd64_3.19.0.tar.gz` tarball could be released\r\n\r\nThis to me is the most preferable option.\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in non-stable builds\r\n\r\nIn non-stable (or perhaps only nightly) builds include Windows binaries, but not in stable releases. This, however, increases the likelihood of someone trying to run future releases on mainnet. \r\n\r\n### Foundation builds Windows binaries\r\n\r\nIf the Inc does not want to release binaries, the Foundation could have a seperate pipeline specifically for Windows builds that are not officially supported. \r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nRequires modification to the release workflows of `go-algorand` or build server infra for the Foundation\r\n\r\n## Urgency\r\n\r\nMedium? See aforementioned problems. ",

                "body": "## Status\r\n\r\nThere is no way to get Windows binaries from Algorand Inc or Foundation. If someone comes to use asking for Windows binaries, we point them to third parties or tell them to build from source. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Developers\r\n\r\nRight now docker is required for building on Algorand because of the need to run a localnet. This adds a significant amount of friction to the Algorand developer experience because some people might not already have docker installed. This is problematic particularly on Windows because it requires WSL to be installed as well. This has resulted in many hours of devrel time debugging Microsoft's software that we have no control over. It's also a non-trivial download for those in areas with poor internet connectivity.\r\n\r\nOn MacOS, docker is also not a light process because it requires a VM to be running the background. I personally have had issues with Docker daemon on Mac and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Most of the time a simple force quite solves the problem, but still annoying. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Node Runners\r\n\r\nRight now there are multiple third parties distributing binaries and node runners have to choose one to trust. Not only do they have to trust that there aren't any malicious code injections, but they also have to trust that the third party will continue to release binaries as there are new consensus updates. This is even more important once we get mining incentives.\r\n\r\n### Problems for Algorand\r\n\r\nBecause we are forcing people to use third party binaries, if problems were to ever arise with one of these binaries Algorand as a network and likely Inc/Foundation as entities would get blamed. \"Algorand node software compromised with malware\" is not a good headline for the perception of the network, regardless of who is actually responsible. While this situation may seem unlikely, take a look at MyAlgo and how many people still believe that this was a problem with Algorand and/or the Foundation.\r\n\r\n## Expected\r\n\r\nThere should be a way, even if not officially supported, for developers and node runners to acquire `go-algorand` binaries without having to go through a third party. This offers benefits for two separate groups of people.\r\n\r\n ## Solution\r\n\r\nI see a couple of solutions as a reasonable path forward:\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in `go-algorand` releases\r\n\r\nFor every software release, a `UNSUPPORTED_node_stable_win-amd64_3.19.0.tar.gz` tarball could be released\r\n\r\nThis to me is the most preferable option.\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in non-stable builds\r\n\r\nIn non-stable (or perhaps only nightly) builds include Windows binaries, but not in stable releases. This, however, increases the likelihood of someone trying to run future releases on mainnet. \r\n\r\n### Foundation builds Windows binaries\r\n\r\nIf the Inc does not want to release binaries, the Foundation could have a seperate pipeline specifically for Windows builds that are not officially supported. \r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nRequires modification to the release workflows of `go-algorand` or build server infra for the Foundation\r\n\r\n## Urgency\r\n\r\nMedium?

                "body": "## Status\r\n\r\nThere is no way to get Windows binaries from Algorand Inc or Foundation. If someone comes to use asking for Windows binaries, we point them to third parties or tell them to build from source. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Developers\r\n\r\nRight now docker is required for building on Algorand because of the need to run a localnet. This adds a significant amount of friction to the Algorand developer experience because some people might not already have docker installed. This is problematic particularly on Windows because it requires WSL to be installed as well. This has resulted in many hours of devrel time debugging Microsoft's software that we have no control over. It's also a non-trivial download for those in areas with poor internet connectivity.\r\n\r\nOn MacOS, docker is also not a light process because it requires a VM to be running the background. I personally have had issues with Docker daemon on Mac and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Most of the time a simple force quite solves the problem, but still annoying. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Node Runners\r\n\r\nRight now there are multiple third parties distributing binaries and node runners have to choose one to trust. Not only do they have to trust that there aren't any malicious code injections, but they also have to trust that the third party will continue to release binaries as there are new consensus updates. This is even more important once we get mining incentives.\r\n\r\n### Problems for Algorand\r\n\r\nBecause we are forcing people to use third party binaries, if problems were to ever arise with one of these binaries Algorand as a network and likely Inc/Foundation as entities would get blamed. \"Algorand node software compromised with malware\" is not a good headline for the perception of the network, regardless of who is actually responsible. While this situation may seem unlikely, take a look at MyAlgo and how many people still believe that this was a problem with Algorand and/or the Foundation.\r\n\r\n## Expected\r\n\r\nThere should be a way, even if not officially supported, for developers and node runners to acquire `go-algorand` binaries without having to go through a third party. This offers benefits for two separate groups of people.\r\n\r\n ## Solution\r\n\r\nI see a couple of solutions as a reasonable path forward:\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in `go-algorand` releases\r\n\r\nFor every software release, a `UNSUPPORTED_node_stable_win-amd64_3.19.0.tar.gz` tarball could be released\r\n\r\nThis to me is the most preferable option.\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in non-stable builds\r\n\r\nIn non-stable (or perhaps only nightly) builds include Windows binaries, but not in stable releases. This, however, increases the likelihood of someone trying to run future releases on mainnet. \r\n\r\n### Foundation builds Windows binaries\r\n\r\nIf the Inc does not want to release binaries, the Foundation could have a seperate pipeline specifically for Windows builds that are not officially supported. \r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nRequires modification to the release workflows of `go-algorand` or build server infra for the Foundation\r\n\r\n## Urgency\r\n\r\nMedium? See aforementioned problems. ",

                "body": "Here's something else to consider. As of right now, there have been 406 keys generated using Aust's One-Click Node. The stats collection I setup for this is rudimentary and doesn't distinguish between Algorand/Voi nor does it distinguish between OS. Also a generated key doesn't necessarily equate to someone participating. However, I'd say a good guess for how many of those are Algo/Windows users would be ~100. If you don't care about which chain, I'd guess ~200 people are using windows binaries.\r\n\r\nWith that preface, I think the Foundation needs to start providing windows binaries, and here is why. Imagine that the next version has a protocol-level change and requires all nodes to update but a part of the code doesn't work on windows. All 200 of those current, non-technical node runners will suddenly be unable to participate in consensus. And when they ask me why I didn't update A1CN so they could participate, I'm just gonna pass the blame right down the line (no offense). And sure, the Foundation can say that they've never supported windows binaries, but I have a feeling that those node runners won't take that response very well. Speaking of bad headlines: \"Algorand update prevents Windows users from participating in consensus.\"\r\n\r\nI understand that it would be a significant undertaking for the Foundation to support Windows binaries. And obviously I'm not privy to the financial details of the Foundation, but it does seem odd that the Foundation for a coin with a ~$800M market cap can't find the resources to support Windows binaries.\r\n\r\nAnyways, there's my thoughts on the subject.",

                "body": "## Status\r\n\r\nThere is no way to get Windows binaries from Algorand Inc or Foundation. If someone comes to use asking for Windows binaries, we point them to third parties or tell them to build from source. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Developers\r\n\r\nRight now docker is required for building on Algorand because of the need to run a localnet. This adds a significant amount of friction to the Algorand developer experience because some people might not already have docker installed. This is problematic particularly on Windows because it requires WSL to be installed as well. This has resulted in many hours of devrel time debugging Microsoft's software that we have no control over. It's also a non-trivial download for those in areas with poor internet connectivity.\r\n\r\nOn MacOS, docker is also not a light process because it requires a VM to be running the background. I personally have had issues with Docker daemon on Mac and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Most of the time a simple force quite solves the problem, but still annoying. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Node Runners\r\n\r\nRight now there are multiple third parties distributing binaries and node runners have to choose one to trust. Not only do they have to trust that there aren't any malicious code injections, but they also have to trust that the third party will continue to release binaries as there are new consensus updates. This is even more important once we get mining incentives.\r\n\r\n### Problems for Algorand\r\n\r\nBecause we are forcing people to use third party binaries, if problems were to ever arise with one of these binaries Algorand as a network and likely Inc/Foundation as entities would get blamed. \"Algorand node software compromised with malware\" is not a good headline for the perception of the network, regardless of who is actually responsible. While this situation may seem unlikely, take a look at MyAlgo and how many people still believe that this was a problem with Algorand and/or the Foundation.\r\n\r\n## Expected\r\n\r\nThere should be a way, even if not officially supported, for developers and node runners to acquire `go-algorand` binaries without having to go through a third party. This offers benefits for two separate groups of people.\r\n\r\n ## Solution\r\n\r\nI see a couple of solutions as a reasonable path forward:\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in `go-algorand` releases\r\n\r\nFor every software release, a `UNSUPPORTED_node_stable_win-amd64_3.19.0.tar.gz` tarball could be released\r\n\r\nThis to me is the most preferable option.\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in non-stable builds\r\n\r\nIn non-stable (or perhaps only nightly) builds include Windows binaries, but not in stable releases. This, however, increases the likelihood of someone trying to run future releases on mainnet. \r\n\r\n### Foundation builds Windows binaries\r\n\r\nIf the Inc does not want to release binaries, the Foundation could have a seperate pipeline specifically for Windows builds that are not officially supported. \r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nRequires modification to the release workflows of `go-algorand` or build server infra for the Foundation\r\n\r\n## Urgency\r\n\r\nMedium? See aforementioned problems. ",

                "body": "> I found the problem!\r\n\r\nYeah that's fair. Probably better for us to just tell people to build from source to de-risk from malicious actors. For bugs though I don't think unsupported binary vs unsupported source code is all that different. \r\n\r\n> Perhaps I am naive, but I don't expect to get blamed if people run the software on a Commodore 64. Windows is a different platform, and if the \"bug\" is platform specific code differences (say the threading/network/process handling behavior is different, which seem to be the most common Windows differences) I actually don't expect blame.\r\n\r\nConsidering people believed things like Tinyman or MyAlgo hack happened because of network vulnerability, I fully believe that a negative headline about Algorand software will reflect poorly on Algorand regardless of whether it was official or not. \r\n\r\n> In my view \"UNSUPPORTED\" is an insufficiently strong caveat. It's not that we don't support you if you have a problem, it's that we're not even claiming it's correct.\r\n\r\nI think the connatation of \"unsupported\" in software is well understood to generally mean \"use at your own risk\" but there might be better wording.

This could cause OOM because of too many pending deltas.\r\n\r\n### Implementation overview\r\n1. Defined max deltas number = 256 used to slow down catchup via a new `Ledger.Available()` method.\r\n2. If `MaxAcctLookback` is manually set greater than 256, use `MaxAcctLookback+1` as a new max.\r\n3. Added a new boolean flag for checking if the ledger is committing right now. If both deltas exceeded and committing then ledger is unavailable.\r\n4. When unavailable, catchup service stops blocks fetching similarly to what happens with catchpoint file writing.\r\n\r\nAdditionally moved `trackerRegistry.dbRound` initialization from `initialize` to `loadFromDisk` to 1) simplify testing 2) it seems naturally belongs to `loadFromDisk`.\r\n\r\n### Considered improvement(s) [not implemented]\r\n1. It is possible to use max deltas value to force flushing in addition on max accounts and time delay.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests to catchup and ledger packages.\r\nRun a manual mainnet catchup test.\r\n\r\n| Memory usage  | algod_ledger_round - algod_ledger_dbround | node.log `.details.NewBase - .details.OldBase` |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n|  ![mm heap](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/assets/65323360/08337e64-8c81-4220-80d8-a4bd7051bcde) | ![metrics_viz](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/assets/65323360/67e1ee58-3aca-4f97-b83d-1ec4d5635845) | ![deltas](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/assets/65323360/17354cdd-b1d2-4637-a550-2db24c3362de) |\r\n\r\n",

This could cause OOM because of too many pending deltas.\r\n\r\n### Implementation overview\r\n1. Defined max deltas number = 256 used to slow down catchup via a new `Ledger.Available()` method.\r\n2. If `MaxAcctLookback` is manually set greater than 256, use `MaxAcctLookback+1` as a new max.\r\n3. Added a new boolean flag for checking if the ledger is committing right now. If both deltas exceeded and committing then ledger is unavailable.\r\n4. When unavailable, catchup service stops blocks fetching similarly to what happens with catchpoint file writing.\r\n\r\nAdditionally moved `trackerRegistry.dbRound` initialization from `initialize` to `loadFromDisk` to 1) simplify testing 2) it seems naturally belongs to `loadFromDisk`.\r\n\r\n### Considered improvement(s) [not implemented]\r\n1. It is possible to use max deltas value to force flushing in addition on max accounts and time delay.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests to catchup and ledger packages.\r\nRun a manual mainnet catchup test.\r\n\r\n| Memory usage  | algod_ledger_round - algod_ledger_dbround | node.log `.details.NewBase - .details.OldBase` |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n|  ![mm heap](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/assets/65323360/08337e64-8c81-4220-80d8-a4bd7051bcde) | ![metrics_viz](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/assets/65323360/67e1ee58-3aca-4f97-b83d-1ec4d5635845) | ![deltas](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/assets/65323360/17354cdd-b1d2-4637-a550-2db24c3362de) |\r\n\r\n",

If someone comes to use asking for Windows binaries, we point them to third parties or tell them to build from source. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Developers\r\n\r\nRight now docker is required for building on Algorand because of the need to run a localnet. This adds a significant amount of friction to the Algorand developer experience because some people might not already have docker installed. This is problematic particularly on Windows because it requires WSL to be installed as well. This has resulted in many hours of devrel time debugging Microsoft's software that we have no control over. It's also a non-trivial download for those in areas with poor internet connectivity.\r\n\r\nOn MacOS, docker is also not a light process because it requires a VM to be running the background. I personally have had issues with Docker daemon on Mac and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Most of the time a simple force quite solves the problem, but still annoying. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Node Runners\r\n\r\nRight now there are multiple third parties distributing binaries and node runners have to choose one to trust. Not only do they have to trust that there aren't any malicious code injections, but they also have to trust that the third party will continue to release binaries as there are new consensus updates. This is even more important once we get mining incentives.\r\n\r\n### Problems for Algorand\r\n\r\nBecause we are forcing people to use third party binaries, if problems were to ever arise with one of these binaries Algorand as a network and likely Inc/Foundation as entities would get blamed. \"Algorand node software compromised with malware\" is not a good headline for the perception of the network, regardless of who is actually responsible. While this situation may seem unlikely, take a look at MyAlgo and how many people still believe that this was a problem with Algorand and/or the Foundation.\r\n\r\n## Expected\r\n\r\nThere should be a way, even if not officially supported, for developers and node runners to acquire `go-algorand` binaries without having to go through a third party. This offers benefits for two separate groups of people.\r\n\r\n ## Solution\r\n\r\nI see a couple of solutions as a reasonable path forward:\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in `go-algorand` releases\r\n\r\nFor every software release, a `UNSUPPORTED_node_stable_win-amd64_3.19.0.tar.gz` tarball could be released\r\n\r\nThis to me is the most preferable option.\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in non-stable builds\r\n\r\nIn non-stable (or perhaps only nightly) builds include Windows binaries, but not in stable releases. This, however, increases the likelihood of someone trying to run future releases on mainnet. \r\n\r\n### Foundation builds Windows binaries\r\n\r\nIf the Inc does not want to release binaries, the Foundation could have a seperate pipeline specifically for Windows builds that are not officially supported. \r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nRequires modification to the release workflows of `go-algorand` or build server infra for the Foundation\r\n\r\n## Urgency\r\n\r\nMedium?

Windows is a different platform, and if the \"bug\" is platform specific code differences (say the threading/network/process handling behavior is different, which seem to be the most common Windows differences) I actually don't expect blame.\r\n",

This offers benefits for two separate groups of people.\r\n\r\n ## Solution\r\n\r\nI see a couple of solutions as a reasonable path forward:\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in `go-algorand` releases\r\n\r\nFor every software release, a `UNSUPPORTED_node_stable_win-amd64_3.19.0.tar.gz` tarball could be released\r\n\r\nThis to me is the most preferable option.\r\n\r\n### Include unsupported Windows binaries in non-stable builds\r\n\r\nIn non-stable (or perhaps only nightly) builds include Windows binaries, but not in stable releases. This, however, increases the likelihood of someone trying to run future releases on mainnet. \r\n\r\n### Foundation builds Windows binaries\r\n\r\nIf the Inc does not want to release binaries, the Foundation could have a seperate pipeline specifically for Windows builds that are not officially supported. \r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nRequires modification to the release workflows of `go-algorand` or build server infra for the Foundation\r\n\r\n## Urgency\r\n\r\nMedium?

If someone comes to use asking for Windows binaries, we point them to third parties or tell them to build from source. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Developers\r\n\r\nRight now docker is required for building on Algorand because of the need to run a localnet. This adds a significant amount of friction to the Algorand developer experience because some people might not already have docker installed. This is problematic particularly on Windows because it requires WSL to be installed as well. This has resulted in many hours of devrel time debugging Microsoft's software that we have no control over. It's also a non-trivial download for those in areas with poor internet connectivity.\r\n\r\nOn MacOS, docker is also not a light process because it requires a VM to be running the background. I personally have had issues with Docker daemon on Mac and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Most of the time a simple force quite solves the problem, but still annoying. \r\n\r\n### Problems for Node Runners\r\n\r\nRight now there are multiple third parties distributing binaries and node runners have to choose one to trust. Not only do they have to trust that there aren't any malicious code injections, but they also have to trust that the third party will continue to release binaries as there are new consensus updates. This is even more important once we get mining incentives.\r\n\r\n### Problems for Algorand\r\n\r\nBecause we are forcing people to use third party binaries, if problems were to ever arise with one of these binaries Algorand as a network and likely Inc/Foundation as entities would get blamed. \"Algorand node software compromised with malware\" is not a good headline for the perception of the network, regardless of who is actually responsible.

This could cause OOM because of too many pending deltas.\r\n\r\n### Implementation overview\r\n1. Defined max deltas number = 256 used to slow down catchup via a new `Ledger.Available()` method.\r\n2. If `MaxAcctLookback` is manually set greater than 256, use `MaxAcctLookback+1` as a new max.\r\n3. Added a new boolean flag for checking if the ledger is committing right now. If both deltas exceeded and committing then ledger is unavailable.\r\n4. When unavailable, catchup service stops blocks fetching similarly to what happens with catchpoint file writing.\r\n\r\nAdditionally moved `trackerRegistry.dbRound` initialization from `initialize` to `loadFromDisk` to 1) simplify testing 2) it seems naturally belongs to `loadFromDisk`.\r\n\r\n### Considered improvement(s) [not implemented]\r\n1. It is possible to use max deltas value to force flushing in addition on max accounts and time delay.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests to catchup and ledger packages.\r\nRun a manual mainnet catchup test.\r\n\r\n| Memory usage  | algod_ledger_round - algod_ledger_dbround | node.log `.details.NewBase - .details.OldBase` |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n|  ![mm heap](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/assets/65323360/08337e64-8c81-4220-80d8-a4bd7051bcde) | ![metrics_viz](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/assets/65323360/67e1ee58-3aca-4f97-b83d-1ec4d5635845) | ![deltas](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/assets/65323360/17354cdd-b1d2-4637-a550-2db24c3362de) |\r\n\r\n",

Version `3.19.0.stable [rel/stable] (commit #7037cb3b)`\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Submit appcall with non-ascii logs\r\n1. Call `blocks/{round}` endpoint and parse the logs directly from the block \r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nAll logged data is present and can be decoded client-side.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nThe data is malformed and often (but not always) missing bytes and/or contains the wrong bytes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nA repo reproducing this bug can be seen here: https://github.com/joe-p/block-log-debug/tree/main\r\n\r\nSo far I have only confirmed that this is a bug with logs, but I have a suspicion that it might affect other `[]string` fields in the block like app arguments. I will add some more testcases to the above repo to verify if that is the case.\r\n\r\nThis only affects the `/blocks/` endpoint. There are many tools, such as the ATC and algokit, that rely on logs to parse non-ascii data (ie. ABI return types) from the transaction response and they all work just fine. \r\n\r\nThis is currently blocking progress being made on an event parsing mechanism\r\n",

                "body": "Thanks for creating this issue and including the code to reproduce.\r\n\r\n## Problem \r\n\r\nThere are two reasons you're seeing invalid data, and I'll discuss them below.\r\n\r\n### JSON\r\n\r\nWhen requesting the block as JSON, algod **does not** base64 encode log values. As a result the raw binary log string gets encoded as a JSON string, meaning some characters are not able to be represented and will be replaced by the unicode replacement character, \ufffd or `\\ufffd`. Once replaced with this character, it's not possible to recover the original value.\r\n\r\n### Msgpack\r\n\r\nWhen requesting the block as msgpack, which is a binary format, there's no need to base64 the log values, so the encoded responses does not lose any data. _However_, in this encoding log strings are tagged with the msgpack \"string\" type instead of \"binary.\" When you decode the msgpack values in your javascript client, the msgp library you use sees the \"string\" type and attempts to decode the log value into a string, which isn't possible for all characters and results in the same problematic representation with unicode replacement characters.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nFor context, here's an example of a binary string with some invalid unicode characters being converted to a UTF-8 string.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nnew Uint8Array([61, 180, 118, 220, 39, 166, 43, 68, 219, 116, 105, 84, 121, 46, 122, 136, 233, 221, 15, 174, 247, 19, 50, 176, 184, 221, 66, 188, 171, 36, 135, 121])\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n=\\ufffdv\\ufffd'\\ufffd+D\\ufffdtiTy.z\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\u000f\\ufffd\\ufffd\\u00132\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdB\\ufffd\\ufffd$\\ufffdy\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n=\ufffdv\ufffd'\ufffd+D\ufffdtiTy.z\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\\u000f\ufffd\ufffd\\u00132\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdB\ufffd\ufffd$\ufffdy\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What we can do\r\n\r\n### On the algod side\r\n\r\nDue to backwards compatibility concerns and the fact that msgpack is the canonical encoding for Algorand blocks, unfortunately it would be extremely difficult to modify the msgpack encoding.\r\n\r\nWe _might_ be able to change the JSON response, since it's not supposed to be canonical, but I need to do more research and think about this more.\r\n\r\n### On the client side\r\n\r\nThe [msgpack spec](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md#limitation) does indicate that decoding clients _should_ provide a way to get the raw bytes for strings for exactly this reason, but I've yet to see a javascript msgpack client which offers this. If you can find a client that does this, either in javascript or another language you can use, that would make the msgpack response usable. (Go is the only language which I'm 100% certain allows this, as it does not require strings to be UTF-8, which is why this works for go-algorand.)",

This could cause OOM because of too many pending deltas.\r\n\r\n### Implementation overview\r\n1. Defined max deltas number = 256 used to slow down catchup via a new `Ledger.Available()` method.\r\n2. If `MaxAcctLookback` is manually set greater than 256, use `MaxAcctLookback+1` as a new max.\r\n3. Added a new boolean flag for checking if the ledger is committing right now. If both deltas exceeded and committing then ledger is unavailable.\r\n4. When unavailable, catchup service stops blocks fetching similarly to what happens with catchpoint file writing.\r\n\r\nAdditionally moved `trackerRegistry.dbRound` initialization from `initialize` to `loadFromDisk` to 1) simplify testing 2) it seems naturally belongs to `loadFromDisk`.\r\n\r\n### Considered improvement(s) [not implemented]\r\n1. It is possible to use max deltas value to force flushing in addition on max accounts and time delay.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests to catchup and ledger packages.\r\nRun a manual mainnet catchup test.\r\n\r\n| Memory usage  | algod_ledger_round - algod_ledger_dbround | node.log `.details.NewBase - .details.OldBase` |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n|  ![mm heap](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/assets/65323360/08337e64-8c81-4220-80d8-a4bd7051bcde) | ![metrics_viz](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/assets/65323360/67e1ee58-3aca-4f97-b83d-1ec4d5635845) | ![deltas](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/assets/65323360/17354cdd-b1d2-4637-a550-2db24c3362de) |\r\n\r\n",

This could cause OOM because of too many pending deltas.\r\n\r\n### Implementation overview\r\n1. Defined max deltas number = 256 used to slow down catchup via a new `Ledger.Available()` method.\r\n2. If `MaxAcctLookback` is manually set greater than 256, use `MaxAcctLookback+1` as a new max.\r\n3. Added a new boolean flag for checking if the ledger is committing right now. If both deltas exceeded and committing then ledger is unavailable.\r\n4. When unavailable, catchup service stops blocks fetching similarly to what happens with catchpoint file writing.\r\n\r\nAdditionally moved `trackerRegistry.dbRound` initialization from `initialize` to `loadFromDisk` to 1) simplify testing 2) it seems naturally belongs to `loadFromDisk`.\r\n\r\n### Considered improvement(s) [not implemented]\r\n1. It is possible to use max deltas value to force flushing in addition on max accounts and time delay.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests to catchup and ledger packages.\r\nRun a manual mainnet catchup test.\r\n\r\n| Memory usage  | algod_ledger_round - algod_ledger_dbround | node.log `.details.NewBase - .details.OldBase` |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n|  ![mm heap](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/assets/65323360/08337e64-8c81-4220-80d8-a4bd7051bcde) | ![metrics_viz](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/assets/65323360/67e1ee58-3aca-4f97-b83d-1ec4d5635845) | ![deltas](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/assets/65323360/17354cdd-b1d2-4637-a550-2db24c3362de) |\r\n\r\n",

This could cause OOM because of too many pending deltas.\r\n\r\n### Implementation overview\r\n1. Defined max deltas number = 256 used to slow down catchup via a new `Ledger.Available()` method.\r\n2. If `MaxAcctLookback` is manually set greater than 256, use `MaxAcctLookback+1` as a new max.\r\n3. Added a new boolean flag for checking if the ledger is committing right now. If both deltas exceeded and committing then ledger is unavailable.\r\n4. When unavailable, catchup service stops blocks fetching similarly to what happens with catchpoint file writing.\r\n\r\nAdditionally moved `trackerRegistry.dbRound` initialization from `initialize` to `loadFromDisk` to 1) simplify testing 2) it seems naturally belongs to `loadFromDisk`.\r\n\r\n### Considered improvement(s) [not implemented]\r\n1. It is possible to use max deltas value to force flushing in addition on max accounts and time delay.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests to catchup and ledger packages.\r\nRun a manual mainnet catchup test.\r\n\r\n| Memory usage  | algod_ledger_round - algod_ledger_dbround | node.log `.details.NewBase - .details.OldBase` |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n|  ![mm heap](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/assets/65323360/08337e64-8c81-4220-80d8-a4bd7051bcde) | ![metrics_viz](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/assets/65323360/67e1ee58-3aca-4f97-b83d-1ec4d5635845) | ![deltas](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/assets/65323360/17354cdd-b1d2-4637-a550-2db24c3362de) |\r\n\r\n",

This could cause OOM because of too many pending deltas.\r\n\r\n### Implementation overview\r\n1. Defined max deltas number = 256 used to slow down catchup via a new `Ledger.Available()` method.\r\n2. If `MaxAcctLookback` is manually set greater than 256, use `MaxAcctLookback+1` as a new max.\r\n3. Added a new boolean flag for checking if the ledger is committing right now. If both deltas exceeded and committing then ledger is unavailable.\r\n4. When unavailable, catchup service stops blocks fetching similarly to what happens with catchpoint file writing.\r\n\r\nAdditionally moved `trackerRegistry.dbRound` initialization from `initialize` to `loadFromDisk` to 1) simplify testing 2) it seems naturally belongs to `loadFromDisk`.\r\n\r\n### Considered improvement(s) [not implemented]\r\n1. It is possible to use max deltas value to force flushing in addition on max accounts and time delay.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests to catchup and ledger packages.\r\nRun a manual mainnet catchup test.\r\n\r\n| Memory usage  | algod_ledger_round - algod_ledger_dbround | node.log `.details.NewBase - .details.OldBase` |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n|  ![mm heap](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/assets/65323360/08337e64-8c81-4220-80d8-a4bd7051bcde) | ![metrics_viz](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/assets/65323360/67e1ee58-3aca-4f97-b83d-1ec4d5635845) | ![deltas](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/assets/65323360/17354cdd-b1d2-4637-a550-2db24c3362de) |\r\n\r\n",
