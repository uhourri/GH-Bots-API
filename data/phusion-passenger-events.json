Cookies names, like `user_id` are being prepended with `[\"`, turning it into `[\"user_id`, so, important authentication scripts like\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nif cookies[:user_id].blank?\r\n```\r\n\r\njust doesn't work.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"633\" alt=\"271427206-96f86b61-c7bf-4e1c-b616-bfba3ab664c2\" src=\"https://github.com/phusion/passenger/assets/3427344/f04b4338-5c2e-4023-82cf-c2d240d36a2e\">\r\n\r\nThis happens after upgrading a Ruby on Rails project from Rails 7.0.8 (using Rack 2.2) to Rails 7.1 (which uses Rack 3.0). This is not a Rails issue, as downgrading from Rack 3 to Rack 2 solves it.\r\n\r\nThere is no error when using Rack 3 without Passenger (for example, Nginx with Puma), so this is not a Rack issue either.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that Rack 3 is the default for Ruby on Rails 7.1, so, new apps and upgraded apps could break!\r\n\r\n**Question 2: Passenger version and integration mode**:\r\nopen source 6.0.18/nginx 1.18.0\r\n\r\n**Question 3: OS or Linux distro, platform (including version)**:\r\nUbuntu 22.04.3 LTS x86-64\r\n\r\n**Question 4: Passenger installation method**:\r\n\r\nYour answer:\r\n[ ] RubyGems + Gemfile\r\n[ ] RubyGems, no Gemfile\r\n[x] Phusion APT repo\r\n[ ] Phusion YUM repo\r\n[ ] OS X Homebrew\r\n[ ] source tarball\r\n[ ] Other, please specify:\r\n\r\n**Question 5: Your app's programming language (including any version managers) and framework (including versions)**:\r\nRuby 3.2.2 with YJIT, RVM, Rails 7.1 RC2\r\n\r\n**Question 6: Are you using a PaaS and/or containerization? If so which one?**\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n**Question 7: Anything else about your setup that we should know?**\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe strive for quality and appreciate you taking the time to submit a report! Please note that if you want guaranteed response times and priority issue support we encourage you to join our [enterprise customer](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/features#premium-features) base.
