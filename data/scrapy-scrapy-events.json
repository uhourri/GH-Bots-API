This is the result of the serialization and deserialization process. This behavior should be noted in the documentation.\r\n\r\n# Suggestion\r\n\r\nAs I suggested in #6119, the next note (or its variation) can added to [jobs documentation](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/jobs.html):\r\n\r\n> *(after the paragraph about debug setting)*\r\nKeep in mind, that deserialization of requests creates deep copies of the objects passed to\r\ndictionary `cb_kwargs`. Meaning, that any mutable object inside `cb_kwargs` (directly or as a part\r\nof other object) does not make its way to the callback; the callback receives its exact copy. Any\r\nchanges made to the copy does not affect the original object.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, note can be added to [`cb_kwargs`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html#scrapy.http.Request) as well:\r\n\r\n> A dict with arbitrary data that will be passed as keyword arguments to the Request\u2019s callback.\r\n**Caution**\r\nOne should not pass mutable objects to this dictionary if setting `JOBDIR` is set. Common mutable objects are lists, dicts, sets and bytearrays. Check [pausing and resuming crawls](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/jobs.html#topics-jobs) documentation for more information.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nMaking deep copies of `cb_kwargs` content when `JOBDIR` is set, is not obvious at a glance. Enabling `JOBDIR` is easy, and one can set it without realization that previously working code will stop working.\r\n\r\n# Additional context\r\n\r\nIn #6119 I also suggested that when `JOBDIR` is set, a warning can be emitted if there is a common mutable object (such as lists, dicts, sets, bytearrays and array from Python `array` module) inside `cb_kwargs` values. However, now I think this is unnecessary and can lead to redundant warnings. Especially in cases when mutable object is passed, but there is no intent in mutating it inside request's callback; for example, dictionaries does not have immutable analogue and `types.MappingProxyType` is not pickleable.",

If `_a` is increasing over time, then every attempt will take more time.
