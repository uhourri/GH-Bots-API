I'm here because in setting up an application in Winetricks on Linux Mint I've run into dead links for corefonts and .net installs, which aren't really dead...the server is down. I see that apparently winetricks draws all of these sorts of packages from the web archive, but in reading comments on isitdownrightnow.com I see that (including right now) the site is down quite a bit and for indeterminate lengths of time (like now...hour and a half so far).\r\n\r\nI'm sure it's been asked ad nauseum, but are there any other server systems from where Winetricks, Inc. could store/draw the various packages? Maybe two or three storage solutions to guard against this sort of thing. How about Mega? Fortunately I've got another production machine I'd already setup, but judging by the many server down situations documented, I'm dead in the water on this setup until somebody turns the lights back on at Wayback Machine Central.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

Fortunately I've got another production machine I'd already setup, but judging by the many server down situations documented, I'm dead in the water on this setup until somebody turns the lights back on at Wayback Machine Central.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

This causes an issue in the Lutris Flatpak when using fallback archive.org URLs because the Flatpak runtime includes wget2: https://github.com/flathub/net.lutris.Lutris/issues/365#issuecomment-1741590369.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion was to explicitly set the Accept header to accept any content type instead of preferring HTML (https://gitlab.com/gnuwget/wget2/-/issues/646#note_1584888546). I've checked that this both fixes the issue with wget2 for these URLs and that the parameter also works with wget 1.x. Hopefully this is effectively a no-op change with wget 1.x because it already defaults to this behaviour. It seems like it should be fine, but I've only tested it with the problematic archive.org URLs so unfortunately I can't promise that this change won't break other sites.",

                "body": "Hi, I've seen a few issues here, including one just two days ago about broken links on web archive. I'm here because in setting up an application in Winetricks on Linux Mint I've run into dead links for corefonts and .net installs, which aren't really dead...the server is down. I see that apparently winetricks draws all of these sorts of packages from the web archive, but in reading comments on isitdownrightnow.com I see that (including right now) the site is down quite a bit and for indeterminate lengths of time (like now...hour and a half so far).\r\n\r\nI'm sure it's been asked ad nauseum, but are there any other server systems from where Winetricks, Inc. could store/draw the various packages? Maybe two or three storage solutions to guard against this sort of thing. How about Mega? Fortunately I've got another production machine I'd already setup, but judging by the many server down situations documented, I'm dead in the water on this setup until somebody turns the lights back on at Wayback Machine Central.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

                "body": "Hi, I've seen a few issues here, including one just two days ago about broken links on web archive. I'm here because in setting up an application in Winetricks on Linux Mint I've run into dead links for corefonts and .net installs, which aren't really dead...the server is down. I see that apparently winetricks draws all of these sorts of packages from the web archive, but in reading comments on isitdownrightnow.com I see that (including right now) the site is down quite a bit and for indeterminate lengths of time (like now...hour and a half so far).\r\n\r\nI'm sure it's been asked ad nauseum, but are there any other server systems from where Winetricks, Inc. could store/draw the various packages? Maybe two or three storage solutions to guard against this sort of thing. How about Mega? Fortunately I've got another production machine I'd already setup, but judging by the many server down situations documented, I'm dead in the water on this setup until somebody turns the lights back on at Wayback Machine Central.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

I did reproduce the problem by manually using 'wget2' to download from the archive.\r\n\r\nSo, if everyone that are having this issue are using Flatpak and/or Lutris (or 'wget2' for some other reason), it makes a lot more sense.\r\n\r\n[BloxedRetro](https://github.com/BloxedRetro),\r\n\r\n> I'm gonna rephrase my last question the wording was weird.\r\n> \r\n> What should I do now that I've found the executable?\r\n\r\nApologies for the delayed response, sleep got to me.  ^^;\r\n\r\nIf your use case is identical to the others here, I guess you might have the\r\n\r\n`/home/deck/.var/app/net.lutris.Lutris/cache/winetricks/vcrun2019`\r\n\r\npath as well.\r\n\r\nYou would want to put the files manually downloaded from the archive there, and then simply re-run the install.  Note that due to the issue with 'wget2', you may have a very small files there, named 'VC_redist.x86.exe' for example, and they are just text files with html in them.  The real size of that file should be around 14 MiB.\r\n\r\nThat said, if the Flatpak thingy has been modified for this, I suppose it should work after updating it, per the previous comment [1].\r\n\r\nFlatpak and Lutris are separate projects, and I personally have no experience of using them at all, so I can not give very detailed support on using them without doing more research myself.\r\n\r\n1. https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks/issues/2136#issuecomment-1780069689\r\n",

I'm here because in setting up an application in Winetricks on Linux Mint I've run into dead links for corefonts and .net installs, which aren't really dead...the server is down. I see that apparently winetricks draws all of these sorts of packages from the web archive, but in reading comments on isitdownrightnow.com I see that (including right now) the site is down quite a bit and for indeterminate lengths of time (like now...hour and a half so far).\r\n\r\nI'm sure it's been asked ad nauseum, but are there any other server systems from where Winetricks, Inc. could store/draw the various packages? Maybe two or three storage solutions to guard against this sort of thing. How about Mega? Fortunately I've got another production machine I'd already setup, but judging by the many server down situations documented, I'm dead in the water on this setup until somebody turns the lights back on at Wayback Machine Central.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

I'm here because in setting up an application in Winetricks on Linux Mint I've run into dead links for corefonts and .net installs, which aren't really dead...the server is down. I see that apparently winetricks draws all of these sorts of packages from the web archive, but in reading comments on isitdownrightnow.com I see that (including right now) the site is down quite a bit and for indeterminate lengths of time (like now...hour and a half so far).\r\n\r\nI'm sure it's been asked ad nauseum, but are there any other server systems from where Winetricks, Inc. could store/draw the various packages? Maybe two or three storage solutions to guard against this sort of thing. How about Mega? Fortunately I've got another production machine I'd already setup, but judging by the many server down situations documented, I'm dead in the water on this setup until somebody turns the lights back on at Wayback Machine Central.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

I'm a linux noob and don't know what files and folders everything would need to go under. Also, I'm trying this on a Steam Deck so I'd have to hope that my files go into the correct CompatData folder. I've had my device on for over 24-hours so I don't know if that'll dictate where my files go.\r\n\r\nI don't have any personal experience with Steam Deck, but if you can find the log file, or find the info elsewhere, I'd imagine it also downloads the file to a specific path, similar to the log in a previous post:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nExecuting cd /home/deck/.var/app/net.lutris.Lutris/cache/winetricks/vcrun2019\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo there the Winetricks cache is under `/home/deck/.var/app/net.lutris.Lutris/cache/winetricks/`.  The actual executable for vcrun would be under that `vcrun2019` directory.\r\n\r\n[chengstark](https://github.com/chengstark),\r\n\r\n> Thanks! Do you know where should we put the downloaded files?\r\n\r\nSee above.  : ]\r\n\r\n[AndnixSH](https://github.com/AndnixSH),\r\n\r\n> Could it be the issue with Debian distros? because when I tried to download Arial font on Linux Mint, Ubuntu and Debian, all are getting same issue. What Linux distro are you using?\r\n\r\nI'm using Gentoo Linux, but I don't think that should matter, especially if you can not download the file even through that link directly using a web browser (or 'wget' or 'curl' or other).\r\n",
