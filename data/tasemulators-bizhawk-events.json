The single exception is if you pass `--mono-no-redirect` as the *first flag*, which *disables* redirecting stdout/stderr to `EmuHawkMono_last*.txt` (the default behaviour is to write to disk instead of the terminal).\r\n- When it inevitably crashes, some errors go to the terminal/`EmuHawkMono_last*.txt`, some appear in dialog boxes, some both. Most of these error dialogs will either have a \"Copy\" button, or will allow Ctrl+C.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs of 2.9, the following systems can be emulated:\r\n- [x] Apple II with **Virtu**\r\n- [x] Arcades with **MAME**\r\n- [x] Atari 2600 with **Atari2600Hawk**\r\n- [x] Atari 7800 with **A7800Hawk**\r\n- [x] Atari Jaguar with VirtualJaguar\r\n- [x] Atari Lynx with **Handy**\r\n- [x] ColecoVision with **ColecoHawk**\r\n- [x] Commodore 64 with **C64Hawk** (loads to BASIC prompt, at least --yoshi)\r\n- [x] Game Boy and GBC with **Gambatte**, **GBHawk**, or **SameBoy**\r\n- [x] GBA with **mGBA**\r\n- [x] Intellivision with **IntelliHawk**\r\n- [x] Magnavox Odyssey\u00b2 with **O2Hawk**\r\n- [x] MSX with **MSXHawk**\r\n- [x] N64 with **Ares64**\r\n- [x] Neo Geo Pocket / Color with **NeoPop**\r\n- [x] NES/Famicom plus FDS with **NesHawk** or **QuickNes**\r\n- [x] Nintendo DS with **melonDS**\r\n- [x] Nintendo Virtual Boy with **Virtual Boyee**\r\n- [x] PC Engine / TG-16 and SuperGrafx plus CD with **HyperNyma**, **PCEHawk**, or **TurboNyma**\r\n- [x] PC-FX with **T.S.T.**\r\n- [x] PSX with **Nymashock**\r\n- [x] Sega 32X with **PicoDrive**\r\n- [x] Sega CD with **Genplus-gx**\r\n- [x] Sega Game Gear with **SMSHawk**\r\n- [x] Sega Genesis / Mega Drive with **Genplus-gx**\r\n- [x] Sega Master System with **SMSHawk**\r\n- [x] Sega Saturn with **Saturnus** (see \"Issues with Saturnus\" below)\r\n- [x] Sega SG-1000 **SMSHawk**\r\n- [x] SNES/SFC with **BSNES**, **Faust**, or **Snes9x**\r\n- [x] Super Game Boy with **Gambatte** or **BSNES**\r\n- [x] TI-83 with **Emu83** or **TI83Hawk**\r\n- [x] TIC-80 fantasy console with **TIC-80** reference implementation\r\n- [x] Uzebox fantasy console with **Uzem**\r\n- [x] Vectrex with **VectrexHawk**\r\n- [x] WonderSwan / Color with **Cygne**\r\n- [x] ZX Spectrum with **ZXHawk**\r\n- [x] Anything else via Libretro cores (provided they don't crash)\r\n\r\nThese systems haven't been tested or aren't finished:\r\n- [ ] 3DS with Citra (unreleased core)\r\n- [ ] Amstrad CPC with CPCHawk (unreleased core)\r\n- [ ] Channel F with ChannelFHawk (unreleased core)\r\n- [ ] Sega Pico with Genplus-gx (I don't have roms --yoshi)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThese features/subsystems work:\r\n- The core lifecycle i.e. loading roms (for the systems noted above)\r\n- Savestates\r\n- Virtual Pad\r\n- Tool Box\r\n- Lua Console (scripts can load, YMMV)\r\n- `Config` > `Controllers...` and `Config` > `Hotkeys...`\r\n\t- Keyboard, mouse, and gamepad inputs, and from 2.9.2, haptic feedback\r\n- `Config` > `Display...` (does not crash)\r\n- `Config` > `Sound...` (does not crash)\r\n- `Config` > `Paths...` (does not crash)\r\n- `Config` > `Firmwares...` (opens)\r\n- `Config` > `Autofire...` (does not crash)\r\n- `Config` > `Customize...` (does not crash)\r\n- `Config` > `Profiles...` (does not crash)\r\n- Core selector (`Config` > `Cores`)\r\n- `View` > `Window Size`\r\n- Misc. OSD layers under `View`\r\n- Lua (from 2.9, same as Windows, before 2.9 see #2951)\r\n- External tools (ApiHawk)\r\n- Movie playback, \"traditional\" movie recording (does not crash, basic functionality is good)\r\n- TAStudio (does not crash, basic functionality is good)\r\n- `Tools` > `RAM Watch` (does not crash, basic functionality is good)\r\n- Hex Editor (works as of https://github.com/TASEmulators/BizHawk/commit/625c657531e757b96aded78048c72a212722f139)\r\n- RAM Search (does not crash, basic functionality is good)\r\n- `Tools` > `Cheats` (does not crash)\r\n- Basic Bot (opens as of https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk/commit/1dbcdcdfc1ac89b8367efae897fd6e39573f82d0)\r\n- RetroAchievements",

The repro steps work as expected with the included HelloWorld project, and my own external tool project can also hit breakpoints with a debug build of the latest changes, so I'm quite happy.\r\n\r\nMy sneaking suspicion was that Mono was somehow noticing, upon the CreateInstanceFrom call, that a given assembly had previously been loaded and choosing to reuse that even though it had no symbols; I thought to do some research in an effort to offer a solution, but a quick bit of googling led me to [comments like this](https://github.com/mono/mono/issues/8149#issuecomment-380605027) detailing the intricacies of Mono's caching mechanisms and my eyes glazed over. That info's a few years out of date, too, so who knows what's going on nowadays?\r\n\r\nSorry to pester you for a patch to something that I suspect hasn't affected even double digit numbers of tool developers yet, but I appreciate you taking the time.

The single exception is if you pass `--mono-no-redirect` as the *first flag*, which *disables* redirecting stdout/stderr to `EmuHawkMono_last*.txt` (the default behaviour is to write to disk instead of the terminal).\r\n- When it inevitably crashes, some errors go to the terminal/`EmuHawkMono_last*.txt`, some appear in dialog boxes, some both. Most of these error dialogs will either have a \"Copy\" button, or will allow Ctrl+C.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs of 2.9, the following systems can be emulated:\r\n- [x] Apple II with **Virtu**\r\n- [x] Arcades with **MAME**\r\n- [x] Atari 2600 with **Atari2600Hawk**\r\n- [x] Atari 7800 with **A7800Hawk**\r\n- [x] Atari Jaguar with VirtualJaguar\r\n- [x] Atari Lynx with **Handy**\r\n- [x] ColecoVision with **ColecoHawk**\r\n- [x] Commodore 64 with **C64Hawk** (loads to BASIC prompt, at least --yoshi)\r\n- [x] Game Boy and GBC with **Gambatte**, **GBHawk**, or **SameBoy**\r\n- [x] GBA with **mGBA**\r\n- [x] Intellivision with **IntelliHawk**\r\n- [x] Magnavox Odyssey\u00b2 with **O2Hawk**\r\n- [x] MSX with **MSXHawk**\r\n- [x] N64 with **Ares64**\r\n- [x] Neo Geo Pocket / Color with **NeoPop**\r\n- [x] NES/Famicom plus FDS with **NesHawk** or **QuickNes**\r\n- [x] Nintendo DS with **melonDS**\r\n- [x] Nintendo Virtual Boy with **Virtual Boyee**\r\n- [x] PC Engine / TG-16 and SuperGrafx plus CD with **HyperNyma**, **PCEHawk**, or **TurboNyma**\r\n- [x] PC-FX with **T.S.T.**\r\n- [x] PSX with **Nymashock**\r\n- [x] Sega 32X with **PicoDrive**\r\n- [x] Sega CD with **Genplus-gx**\r\n- [x] Sega Game Gear with **SMSHawk**\r\n- [x] Sega Genesis / Mega Drive with **Genplus-gx**\r\n- [x] Sega Master System with **SMSHawk**\r\n- [x] Sega Saturn with **Saturnus** (see \"Issues with Saturnus\" below)\r\n- [x] Sega SG-1000 **SMSHawk**\r\n- [x] SNES/SFC with **BSNES**, **Faust**, or **Snes9x**\r\n- [x] Super Game Boy with **Gambatte** or **BSNES**\r\n- [x] TI-83 with **Emu83** or **TI83Hawk**\r\n- [x] TIC-80 fantasy console with **TIC-80** reference implementation\r\n- [x] Uzebox fantasy console with **Uzem**\r\n- [x] Vectrex with **VectrexHawk**\r\n- [x] WonderSwan / Color with **Cygne**\r\n- [x] ZX Spectrum with **ZXHawk**\r\n- [x] Anything else via Libretro cores (provided they don't crash)\r\n\r\nThese systems haven't been tested or aren't finished:\r\n- [ ] 3DS with Citra (unreleased core)\r\n- [ ] Amstrad CPC with CPCHawk (unreleased core)\r\n- [ ] Channel F with ChannelFHawk (unreleased core)\r\n- [ ] Sega Pico with Genplus-gx (I don't have roms --yoshi)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThese features/subsystems work:\r\n- The core lifecycle i.e. loading roms (for the systems noted above)\r\n- Savestates\r\n- Virtual Pad\r\n- Tool Box\r\n- Lua Console (scripts can load, YMMV)\r\n- `Config` > `Controllers...` and `Config` > `Hotkeys...`\r\n\t- Keyboard, mouse, and gamepad inputs, and from 2.9.2, haptic feedback\r\n- `Config` > `Display...` (does not crash)\r\n- `Config` > `Sound...` (does not crash)\r\n- `Config` > `Paths...` (does not crash)\r\n- `Config` > `Firmwares...` (opens)\r\n- `Config` > `Autofire...` (does not crash)\r\n- `Config` > `Customize...` (does not crash)\r\n- `Config` > `Profiles...` (does not crash)\r\n- Core selector (`Config` > `Cores`)\r\n- `View` > `Window Size`\r\n- Misc.

The single exception is if you pass `--mono-no-redirect` as the *first flag*, which *disables* redirecting stdout/stderr to `EmuHawkMono_last*.txt` (the default behaviour is to write to disk instead of the terminal).\r\n- When it inevitably crashes, some errors go to the terminal/`EmuHawkMono_last*.txt`, some appear in dialog boxes, some both. Most of these error dialogs will either have a \"Copy\" button, or will allow Ctrl+C.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs of 2.9, the following systems can be emulated:\r\n- [x] Apple II with **Virtu**\r\n- [x] Arcades with **MAME**\r\n- [x] Atari 2600 with **Atari2600Hawk**\r\n- [x] Atari 7800 with **A7800Hawk**\r\n- [x] Atari Jaguar with VirtualJaguar\r\n- [x] Atari Lynx with **Handy**\r\n- [x] ColecoVision with **ColecoHawk**\r\n- [x] Commodore 64 with **C64Hawk** (loads to BASIC prompt, at least --yoshi)\r\n- [x] Game Boy and GBC with **Gambatte**, **GBHawk**, or **SameBoy**\r\n- [x] GBA with **mGBA**\r\n- [x] Intellivision with **IntelliHawk**\r\n- [x] Magnavox Odyssey\u00b2 with **O2Hawk**\r\n- [x] MSX with **MSXHawk**\r\n- [x] N64 with **Ares64**\r\n- [x] Neo Geo Pocket / Color with **NeoPop**\r\n- [x] NES/Famicom plus FDS with **NesHawk** or **QuickNes**\r\n- [x] Nintendo DS with **melonDS**\r\n- [x] Nintendo Virtual Boy with **Virtual Boyee**\r\n- [x] PC Engine / TG-16 and SuperGrafx plus CD with **HyperNyma**, **PCEHawk**, or **TurboNyma**\r\n- [x] PC-FX with **T.S.T.**\r\n- [x] PSX with **Nymashock**\r\n- [x] Sega 32X with **PicoDrive**\r\n- [x] Sega CD with **Genplus-gx**\r\n- [x] Sega Game Gear with **SMSHawk**\r\n- [x] Sega Genesis / Mega Drive with **Genplus-gx**\r\n- [x] Sega Master System with **SMSHawk**\r\n- [x] Sega Saturn with **Saturnus** (see \"Issues with Saturnus\" below)\r\n- [x] Sega SG-1000 **SMSHawk**\r\n- [x] SNES/SFC with **BSNES**, **Faust**, or **Snes9x**\r\n- [x] Super Game Boy with **Gambatte** or **BSNES**\r\n- [x] TI-83 with **Emu83** or **TI83Hawk**\r\n- [x] TIC-80 fantasy console with **TIC-80** reference implementation\r\n- [x] Uzebox fantasy console with **Uzem**\r\n- [x] Vectrex with **VectrexHawk**\r\n- [x] WonderSwan / Color with **Cygne**\r\n- [x] ZX Spectrum with **ZXHawk**\r\n- [x] Anything else via Libretro cores (provided they don't crash)\r\n\r\nThese systems haven't been tested or aren't finished:\r\n- [ ] 3DS with Citra (unreleased core)\r\n- [ ] Amstrad CPC with CPCHawk (unreleased core)\r\n- [ ] Channel F with ChannelFHawk (unreleased core)\r\n- [ ] Sega Pico with Genplus-gx (I don't have roms --yoshi)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThese features/subsystems work:\r\n- The core lifecycle i.e. loading roms (for the systems noted above)\r\n- Savestates\r\n- Virtual Pad\r\n- Tool Box\r\n- Lua Console (scripts can load, YMMV)\r\n- `Config` > `Controllers...` and `Config` > `Hotkeys...`\r\n\t- Keyboard, mouse, and gamepad inputs, and from 2.9.2, haptic feedback\r\n- `Config` > `Display...` (does not crash)\r\n- `Config` > `Sound...` (does not crash)\r\n- `Config` > `Paths...` (does not crash)\r\n- `Config` > `Firmwares...` (opens)\r\n- `Config` > `Autofire...` (does not crash)\r\n- `Config` > `Customize...` (does not crash)\r\n- `Config` > `Profiles...` (does not crash)\r\n- Core selector (`Config` > `Cores`)\r\n- `View` > `Window Size`\r\n- Misc.

A bisect back when I was initially investigating this showed that commit as being the culprit, and checking again now, I still see that the prior commit, f9ac3c4b32ad55ef99e0b000c3f1b8355ab59057, doesn't exhibit the problem.\r\n\r\nMy repro steps earlier last time made use of tag 2.9.1, but to be on the safe side I pulled, did a hard reset to master, then checked out commit 4566b744d9528ae33fbf3d887476ae9c1153da85 and walked through my instructions again. The commit, unmodified, refuses to break on the first line of the HelloWorld tool's constructor, but sure enough if I change Load(asmBytes) to LoadFrom(fileName), which is on line 129 of ExternalToolManager.cs in this commit, it breaks as expected.\r\n\r\nI couldn't even venture a guess as to why that code would affect anything, especially if it doesn't even do the actual assembly loading. It doesn't seem to be a problem in Windows under .NET, mind you, only in Linux with Mono; I'm unfamiliar with what they do differently when it comes to assembly loading.",

                "body": "[jump to known bugs](https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk/issues/1430#issuecomment-451916885)\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n- Nothing on this page applies to the (discontinued) macOS port.\r\n- Build instructions are in the readme. tl;dr: run `Dist/BuildRelease.sh`.\r\n- \"Installation\" instructions are also in the readme. tl;dr: run `output/EmuHawkMono.sh`.\r\n\t- *No WINE required!* If you get it working in WINE, good for you, but I'm going to ignore you and hide any counter-productive comments.\r\n- 35-ish of 40-ish systems can be emulated, with the notable exception of N64 (Mupen64Plus isn't available, and the experimental Ares64 core is too slow).\r\n- For casual players, most things work as they would on Windows.\r\n- Command-line flags to `EmuHawkMono.sh` are passed through as expected. The single exception is if you pass `--mono-no-redirect` as the *first flag*, which *disables* redirecting stdout/stderr to `EmuHawkMono_last*.txt` (the default behaviour is to write to disk instead of the terminal).\r\n- When it inevitably crashes, some errors go to the terminal/`EmuHawkMono_last*.txt`, some appear in dialog boxes, some both. Most of these error dialogs will either have a \"Copy\" button, or will allow Ctrl+C.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs of 2.9, the following systems can be emulated:\r\n- [x] Apple II with **Virtu**\r\n- [x] Arcades with **MAME**\r\n- [x] Atari 2600 with **Atari2600Hawk**\r\n- [x] Atari 7800 with **A7800Hawk**\r\n- [x] Atari Jaguar with VirtualJaguar\r\n- [x] Atari Lynx with **Handy**\r\n- [x] ColecoVision with **ColecoHawk**\r\n- [x] Commodore 64 with **C64Hawk** (loads to BASIC prompt, at least --yoshi)\r\n- [x] Game Boy and GBC with **Gambatte**, **GBHawk**, or **SameBoy**\r\n- [x] GBA with **mGBA**\r\n- [x] Intellivision with **IntelliHawk**\r\n- [x] Magnavox Odyssey\u00b2 with **O2Hawk**\r\n- [x] MSX with **MSXHawk**\r\n- [x] N64 with **Ares64**\r\n- [x] Neo Geo Pocket / Color with **NeoPop**\r\n- [x] NES/Famicom plus FDS with **NesHawk** or **QuickNes**\r\n- [x] Nintendo DS with **melonDS**\r\n- [x] Nintendo Virtual Boy with **Virtual Boyee**\r\n- [x] PC Engine / TG-16 and SuperGrafx plus CD with **HyperNyma**, **PCEHawk**, or **TurboNyma**\r\n- [x] PC-FX with **T.S.T.**\r\n- [x] PSX with **Nymashock**\r\n- [x] Sega 32X with **PicoDrive**\r\n- [x] Sega CD with **Genplus-gx**\r\n- [x] Sega Game Gear with **SMSHawk**\r\n- [x] Sega Genesis / Mega Drive with **Genplus-gx**\r\n- [x] Sega Master System with **SMSHawk**\r\n- [x] Sega Saturn with **Saturnus** (see \"Issues with Saturnus\" below)\r\n- [x] Sega SG-1000 **SMSHawk**\r\n- [x] SNES/SFC with **BSNES**, **Faust**, or **Snes9x**\r\n- [x] Super Game Boy with **Gambatte** or **BSNES**\r\n- [x] TI-83 with **Emu83** or **TI83Hawk**\r\n- [x] TIC-80 fantasy console with **TIC-80** reference implementation\r\n- [x] Uzebox fantasy console with **Uzem**\r\n- [x] Vectrex with **VectrexHawk**\r\n- [x] WonderSwan / Color with **Cygne**\r\n- [x] ZX Spectrum with **ZXHawk**\r\n- [x] Anything else via Libretro cores (provided they don't crash)\r\n\r\nThese systems haven't been tested or aren't finished:\r\n- [ ] 3DS with Citra (unreleased core)\r\n- [ ] Amstrad CPC with CPCHawk (unreleased core)\r\n- [ ] Channel F with ChannelFHawk (unreleased core)\r\n- [ ] Sega Pico with Genplus-gx (I don't have roms --yoshi)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThese features/subsystems work:\r\n- The core lifecycle i.e. loading roms (for the systems noted above)\r\n- Savestates\r\n- Virtual Pad\r\n- Tool Box\r\n- Lua Console (scripts can load, YMMV)\r\n- `Config` > `Controllers...` and `Config` > `Hotkeys...`\r\n\t- Keyboard, mouse, and gamepad inputs, and from 2.9.2, haptic feedback\r\n- `Config` > `Display...` (does not crash)\r\n- `Config` > `Sound...` (does not crash)\r\n- `Config` > `Paths...` (does not crash)\r\n- `Config` > `Firmwares...` (opens)\r\n- `Config` > `Autofire...` (does not crash)\r\n- `Config` > `Customize...` (does not crash)\r\n- `Config` > `Profiles...` (does not crash)\r\n- Core selector (`Config` > `Cores`)\r\n- `View` > `Window Size`\r\n- Misc.

                "body": "I've found myself using recording mode more recently and I've stumbled upon a potentially dangerous bug:\r\nThere is a way to get recording mode to turn on (by itself), even though it was just turned off. This combined with the fact that recorded input is very hard to undo could possibly lead to losing input.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n1. Open TAStudio with any ROM, in my case I'm using Super Mario World with the new BSNESv115 core\r\n2. Toggle recording mode and enter any inputs for a couple of frames, let's say holding `R` for 10 frames.\r\n3. Remove the `R` input in frame 9 by clicking on it. Then add a `L` input in that frame (or any other), again by clicking in TAStudio and still having recording mode toggled on.\r\n4. Toggle recording mode off by using the \"Toggle read-only\" hotkey (Q by default)\r\n5. jump to any other frame, like frame 2.\r\n\r\nRecording mode gets turned back on now, even though there is no reason for that to happen.",

This combined with the fact that recorded input is very hard to undo could possibly lead to losing input.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n1. Open TAStudio with any ROM, in my case I'm using Super Mario World with the new BSNESv115 core\r\n2. Toggle recording mode and enter any inputs for a couple of frames, let's say holding `R` for 10 frames.\r\n3. Remove the `R` input in frame 9 by clicking on it. Then add a `L` input in that frame (or any other), again by clicking in TAStudio and still having recording mode toggled on.\r\n4. Toggle recording mode off by using the \"Toggle read-only\" hotkey (Q by default)\r\n5. jump to any other frame, like frame 2.\r\n\r\nRecording mode gets turned back on now, even though there is no reason for that to happen.",

This combined with the fact that recorded input is very hard to undo could possibly lead to losing input.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n1. Open TAStudio with any ROM, in my case I'm using Super Mario World with the new BSNESv115 core\r\n2. Toggle recording mode and enter any inputs for a couple of frames, let's say holding `R` for 10 frames.\r\n3. Remove the `R` input in frame 9 by clicking on it. Then add a `L` input in that frame (or any other), again by clicking in TAStudio and still having recording mode toggled on.\r\n4. Toggle recording mode off by using the \"Toggle read-only\" hotkey (Q by default)\r\n5. jump to any other frame, like frame 2.\r\n\r\nRecording mode gets turned back on now, even though there is no reason for that to happen.",
