If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue below. -->\r\nThis PR is improving the Audio Player. The main reason was to change the layout and add the capability to increase/decrease the audio's velocity (rate).\r\n\r\nBeyond the layout stuff, I changed how we handle the audio. Also, I refactor the approach implemented in that PR https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/pull/4662 to avoid the necessity of EventListener. Added to this new approach, we are able to control and unload the audio from other places besides the RoomView and the Component Audio, this could be discussed later.\r\n\r\n## Issue(s)\t\r\n<!-- Link the issues being closed by or related to this PR. For example, you can use #594 if this PR closes issue number 594 -->\r\n\r\n## How to test or reproduce\r\n<!-- Mention how you would reproduce the bug if not mentioned on the issue page already. Also mention which screens are going to have the changes if applicable -->\r\n- Send multiple audios in a single channel to test the play/pause/rate\r\n- Send audio in a thread \r\n    - The audio from a channel will pause when opening the thread\r\n    - If the audio from a thread is playing, then back to the channel, this audio from the thread should stop\r\n - Background listening\r\n - Check if screen is always on while playing an audio and if can go off after is paused\r\n - Play the audio from all clients origin on all clients Android/iOS/Web.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/5b139486-728c-4078-8f87-3ee0fe3aca22\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/01fdc54b-d7a5-461a-8cd1-e28e9b3f5855\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/d49c9fe7-0cb1-48de-bdca-6366963325e9\r\n\r\n\r\n#### With Sound\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/cdd0cd6f-c966-49fb-a6b1-99205ad7999a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!-- What types of changes does your code introduce to Rocket.Chat? -->\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Improvement (non-breaking change which improves a current function)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Documentation update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue below. -->\r\nThis PR is improving the Audio Player. The main reason was to change the layout and add the capability to increase/decrease the audio's velocity (rate).\r\n\r\nBeyond the layout stuff, I changed how we handle the audio. Also, I refactor the approach implemented in that PR https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/pull/4662 to avoid the necessity of EventListener. Added to this new approach, we are able to control and unload the audio from other places besides the RoomView and the Component Audio, this could be discussed later.\r\n\r\n## Issue(s)\t\r\n<!-- Link the issues being closed by or related to this PR.

Also mention which screens are going to have the changes if applicable -->\r\n- Send multiple audios in a single channel to test the play/pause/rate\r\n- Send audio in a thread \r\n    - The audio from a channel will pause when opening the thread\r\n    - If the audio from a thread is playing, then back to the channel, this audio from the thread should stop\r\n - Background listening\r\n - Check if screen is always on while playing an audio and if can go off after is paused\r\n - Play the audio from all clients origin on all clients Android/iOS/Web.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/5b139486-728c-4078-8f87-3ee0fe3aca22\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/01fdc54b-d7a5-461a-8cd1-e28e9b3f5855\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/d49c9fe7-0cb1-48de-bdca-6366963325e9\r\n\r\n\r\n#### With Sound\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/cdd0cd6f-c966-49fb-a6b1-99205ad7999a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!-- What types of changes does your code introduce to Rocket.Chat? -->\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Improvement (non-breaking change which improves a current function)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Documentation update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue below. -->\r\nThis PR is improving the Audio Player. The main reason was to change the layout and add the capability to increase/decrease the audio's velocity (rate).\r\n\r\nBeyond the layout stuff, I changed how we handle the audio. Also, I refactor the approach implemented in that PR https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/pull/4662 to avoid the necessity of EventListener. Added to this new approach, we are able to control and unload the audio from other places besides the RoomView and the Component Audio, this could be discussed later.\r\n\r\n## Issue(s)\t\r\n<!-- Link the issues being closed by or related to this PR.

Also mention which screens are going to have the changes if applicable -->\r\n- Send multiple audios in a single channel to test the play/pause/rate\r\n- Send audio in a thread \r\n    - The audio from a channel will pause when opening the thread\r\n    - If the audio from a thread is playing, then back to the channel, this audio from the thread should stop\r\n - Background listening\r\n - Check if screen is always on while playing an audio and if can go off after is paused\r\n - Play the audio from all clients origin on all clients Android/iOS/Web.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/5b139486-728c-4078-8f87-3ee0fe3aca22\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/01fdc54b-d7a5-461a-8cd1-e28e9b3f5855\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/d49c9fe7-0cb1-48de-bdca-6366963325e9\r\n\r\n\r\n#### With Sound\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/cdd0cd6f-c966-49fb-a6b1-99205ad7999a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!-- What types of changes does your code introduce to Rocket.Chat? -->\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Improvement (non-breaking change which improves a current function)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Documentation update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue below. -->\r\nThis PR is improving the Audio Player. The main reason was to change the layout and add the capability to increase/decrease the audio's velocity (rate).\r\n\r\nBeyond the layout stuff, I changed how we handle the audio. Also, I refactor the approach implemented in that PR https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/pull/4662 to avoid the necessity of EventListener. Added to this new approach, we are able to control and unload the audio from other places besides the RoomView and the Component Audio, this could be discussed later.\r\n\r\n## Issue(s)\t\r\n<!-- Link the issues being closed by or related to this PR.

Also mention which screens are going to have the changes if applicable -->\r\n- Send multiple audios in a single channel to test the play/pause/rate\r\n- Send audio in a thread \r\n    - The audio from a channel will pause when opening the thread\r\n    - If the audio from a thread is playing, then back to the channel, this audio from the thread should stop\r\n - Background listening\r\n - Check if screen is always on while playing an audio and if can go off after is paused\r\n - Play the audio from all clients origin on all clients Android/iOS/Web.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/5b139486-728c-4078-8f87-3ee0fe3aca22\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/01fdc54b-d7a5-461a-8cd1-e28e9b3f5855\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/d49c9fe7-0cb1-48de-bdca-6366963325e9\r\n\r\n\r\n#### With Sound\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/cdd0cd6f-c966-49fb-a6b1-99205ad7999a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!-- What types of changes does your code introduce to Rocket.Chat? -->\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Improvement (non-breaking change which improves a current function)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Documentation update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue below. -->\r\nThis PR is improving the Audio Player. The main reason was to change the layout and add the capability to increase/decrease the audio's velocity (rate).\r\n\r\nBeyond the layout stuff, I changed how we handle the audio. Also, I refactor the approach implemented in that PR https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/pull/4662 to avoid the necessity of EventListener. Added to this new approach, we are able to control and unload the audio from other places besides the RoomView and the Component Audio, this could be discussed later.\r\n\r\n## Issue(s)\t\r\n<!-- Link the issues being closed by or related to this PR.

Also mention which screens are going to have the changes if applicable -->\r\n- Send multiple audios in a single channel to test the play/pause/rate\r\n- Send audio in a thread \r\n    - The audio from a channel will pause when opening the thread\r\n    - If the audio from a thread is playing, then back to the channel, this audio from the thread should stop\r\n - Background listening\r\n - Check if screen is always on while playing an audio and if can go off after is paused\r\n - Play the audio from all clients origin on all clients Android/iOS/Web.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/5b139486-728c-4078-8f87-3ee0fe3aca22\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/01fdc54b-d7a5-461a-8cd1-e28e9b3f5855\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/d49c9fe7-0cb1-48de-bdca-6366963325e9\r\n\r\n\r\n#### With Sound\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/cdd0cd6f-c966-49fb-a6b1-99205ad7999a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!-- What types of changes does your code introduce to Rocket.Chat? -->\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Improvement (non-breaking change which improves a current function)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Documentation update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

We're RN devs, so we know what to expect from a TouchableOpacity, but not users. Might be fixed if you use gesture handler.\r\n- It opens action sheet if I don't move it enough, or fast enough.

If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue below. -->\r\nThis PR is improving the Audio Player. The main reason was to change the layout and add the capability to increase/decrease the audio's velocity (rate).\r\n\r\nBeyond the layout stuff, I changed how we handle the audio. Also, I refactor the approach implemented in that PR https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/pull/4662 to avoid the necessity of EventListener. Added to this new approach, we are able to control and unload the audio from other places besides the RoomView and the Component Audio, this could be discussed later.\r\n\r\n## Issue(s)\t\r\n<!-- Link the issues being closed by or related to this PR.

Also mention which screens are going to have the changes if applicable -->\r\n- Send multiple audios in a single channel to test the play/pause/rate\r\n- Send audio in a thread \r\n    - The audio from a channel will pause when opening the thread\r\n    - If the audio from a thread is playing, then back to the channel, this audio from the thread should stop\r\n - Background listening\r\n - Check if screen is always on while playing an audio and if can go off after is paused\r\n - Play the audio from all clients origin on all clients Android/iOS/Web.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/5b139486-728c-4078-8f87-3ee0fe3aca22\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/01fdc54b-d7a5-461a-8cd1-e28e9b3f5855\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/d49c9fe7-0cb1-48de-bdca-6366963325e9\r\n\r\n\r\n#### With Sound\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/cdd0cd6f-c966-49fb-a6b1-99205ad7999a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!-- What types of changes does your code introduce to Rocket.Chat? -->\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Improvement (non-breaking change which improves a current function)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Documentation update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue below. -->\r\nThis PR is improving the Audio Player. The main reason was to change the layout and add the capability to increase/decrease the audio's velocity (rate).\r\n\r\nBeyond the layout stuff, I changed how we handle the audio. Also, I refactor the approach implemented in that PR https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/pull/4662 to avoid the necessity of EventListener. Added to this new approach, we are able to control and unload the audio from other places besides the RoomView and the Component Audio, this could be discussed later.\r\n\r\n## Issue(s)\t\r\n<!-- Link the issues being closed by or related to this PR.

If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue below. -->\r\nThis PR is improving the Audio Player. The main reason was to change the layout and add the capability to increase/decrease the audio's velocity (rate).\r\n\r\nBeyond the layout stuff, I changed how we handle the audio. Also, I refactor the approach implemented in that PR https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/pull/4662 to avoid the necessity of EventListener. Added to this new approach, we are able to control and unload the audio from other places besides the RoomView and the Component Audio, this could be discussed later.\r\n\r\n## Issue(s)\t\r\n<!-- Link the issues being closed by or related to this PR.

Also mention which screens are going to have the changes if applicable -->\r\n- Send multiple audios in a single channel to test the play/pause/rate\r\n- Send audio in a thread \r\n    - The audio from a channel will pause when opening the thread\r\n    - If the audio from a thread is playing, then back to the channel, this audio from the thread should stop\r\n - Background listening\r\n - Check if screen is always on while playing an audio and if can go off after is paused\r\n - Play the audio from all clients origin on all clients Android/iOS/Web.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/5b139486-728c-4078-8f87-3ee0fe3aca22\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/01fdc54b-d7a5-461a-8cd1-e28e9b3f5855\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/d49c9fe7-0cb1-48de-bdca-6366963325e9\r\n\r\n\r\n#### With Sound\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/cdd0cd6f-c966-49fb-a6b1-99205ad7999a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!-- What types of changes does your code introduce to Rocket.Chat? -->\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Improvement (non-breaking change which improves a current function)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Documentation update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue below. -->\r\nThis PR is improving the Audio Player. The main reason was to change the layout and add the capability to increase/decrease the audio's velocity (rate).\r\n\r\nBeyond the layout stuff, I changed how we handle the audio. Also, I refactor the approach implemented in that PR https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/pull/4662 to avoid the necessity of EventListener. Added to this new approach, we are able to control and unload the audio from other places besides the RoomView and the Component Audio, this could be discussed later.\r\n\r\n## Issue(s)\t\r\n<!-- Link the issues being closed by or related to this PR.

Also mention which screens are going to have the changes if applicable -->\r\n- Send multiple audios in a single channel to test the play/pause/rate\r\n- Send audio in a thread \r\n    - The audio from a channel will pause when opening the thread\r\n    - If the audio from a thread is playing, then back to the channel, this audio from the thread should stop\r\n - Background listening\r\n - Check if screen is always on while playing an audio and if can go off after is paused\r\n - Play the audio from all clients origin on all clients Android/iOS/Web.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/5b139486-728c-4078-8f87-3ee0fe3aca22\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/01fdc54b-d7a5-461a-8cd1-e28e9b3f5855\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/d49c9fe7-0cb1-48de-bdca-6366963325e9\r\n\r\n\r\n#### With Sound\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/cdd0cd6f-c966-49fb-a6b1-99205ad7999a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!-- What types of changes does your code introduce to Rocket.Chat? -->\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Improvement (non-breaking change which improves a current function)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Documentation update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue below. -->\r\nThis PR is improving the Audio Player. The main reason was to change the layout and add the capability to increase/decrease the audio's velocity (rate).\r\n\r\nBeyond the layout stuff, I changed how we handle the audio. Also, I refactor the approach implemented in that PR https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/pull/4662 to avoid the necessity of EventListener.

If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue below. -->\r\nThis PR is improving the Audio Player. The main reason was to change the layout and add the capability to increase/decrease the audio's velocity (rate).\r\n\r\nBeyond the layout stuff, I changed how we handle the audio. Also, I refactor the approach implemented in that PR https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/pull/4662 to avoid the necessity of EventListener. Added to this new approach, we are able to control and unload the audio from other places besides the RoomView and the Component Audio, this could be discussed later.\r\n\r\n## Issue(s)\t\r\n<!-- Link the issues being closed by or related to this PR.

If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue below. -->\r\nThis PR is improving the Audio Player. The main reason was to change the layout and add the capability to increase/decrease the audio's velocity (rate).\r\n\r\nBeyond the layout stuff, I changed how we handle the audio. Also, I refactor the approach implemented in that PR https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/pull/4662 to avoid the necessity of EventListener. Added to this new approach, we are able to control and unload the audio from other places besides the RoomView and the Component Audio, this could be discussed later.\r\n\r\n## Issue(s)\t\r\n<!-- Link the issues being closed by or related to this PR.

Also mention which screens are going to have the changes if applicable -->\r\n- Send multiple audios in a single channel to test the play/pause/rate\r\n- Send audio in a thread \r\n    - The audio from a channel will pause when opening the thread\r\n    - If the audio from a thread is playing, then back to the channel, this audio from the thread should stop\r\n - Background listening\r\n - Check if screen is always on while playing an audio and if can go off after is paused\r\n - Play the audio from all clients origin on all clients Android/iOS/Web.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/5b139486-728c-4078-8f87-3ee0fe3aca22\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/01fdc54b-d7a5-461a-8cd1-e28e9b3f5855\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/d49c9fe7-0cb1-48de-bdca-6366963325e9\r\n\r\n\r\n#### With Sound\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/cdd0cd6f-c966-49fb-a6b1-99205ad7999a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!-- What types of changes does your code introduce to Rocket.Chat? -->\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Improvement (non-breaking change which improves a current function)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Documentation update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue below. -->\r\nThis PR is improving the Audio Player. The main reason was to change the layout and add the capability to increase/decrease the audio's velocity (rate).\r\n\r\nBeyond the layout stuff, I changed how we handle the audio. Also, I refactor the approach implemented in that PR https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/pull/4662 to avoid the necessity of EventListener. Added to this new approach, we are able to control and unload the audio from other places besides the RoomView and the Component Audio, this could be discussed later.\r\n\r\n## Issue(s)\t\r\n<!-- Link the issues being closed by or related to this PR. For example, you can use #594 if this PR closes issue number 594 -->\r\n\r\n## How to test or reproduce\r\n<!-- Mention how you would reproduce the bug if not mentioned on the issue page already.

If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue below. -->\r\nThis PR is improving the Audio Player. The main reason was to change the layout and add the capability to increase/decrease the audio's velocity (rate).\r\n\r\nBeyond the layout stuff, I changed how we handle the audio. Also, I refactor the approach implemented in that PR https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/pull/4662 to avoid the necessity of EventListener. Added to this new approach, we are able to control and unload the audio from other places besides the RoomView and the Component Audio, this could be discussed later.\r\n\r\n## Issue(s)\t\r\n<!-- Link the issues being closed by or related to this PR.

Also mention which screens are going to have the changes if applicable -->\r\n- Send multiple audios in a single channel to test the play/pause/rate\r\n- Send audio in a thread \r\n    - The audio from a channel will pause when opening the thread\r\n    - If the audio from a thread is playing, then back to the channel, this audio from the thread should stop\r\n - Background listening\r\n - Check if screen is always on while playing an audio and if can go off after is paused\r\n - Play the audio from all clients origin on all clients Android/iOS/Web.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/5b139486-728c-4078-8f87-3ee0fe3aca22\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/01fdc54b-d7a5-461a-8cd1-e28e9b3f5855\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/d49c9fe7-0cb1-48de-bdca-6366963325e9\r\n\r\n\r\n#### With Sound\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/cdd0cd6f-c966-49fb-a6b1-99205ad7999a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!-- What types of changes does your code introduce to Rocket.Chat? -->\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Improvement (non-breaking change which improves a current function)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Documentation update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue below. -->\r\nThis PR is improving the Audio Player. The main reason was to change the layout and add the capability to increase/decrease the audio's velocity (rate).\r\n\r\nBeyond the layout stuff, I changed how we handle the audio. Also, I refactor the approach implemented in that PR https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/pull/4662 to avoid the necessity of EventListener.

If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue below. -->\r\nThis PR is improving the Audio Player. The main reason was to change the layout and add the capability to increase/decrease the audio's velocity (rate).\r\n\r\nBeyond the layout stuff, I changed how we handle the audio. Also, I refactor the approach implemented in that PR https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/pull/4662 to avoid the necessity of EventListener. Added to this new approach, we are able to control and unload the audio from other places besides the RoomView and the Component Audio, this could be discussed later.\r\n\r\n## Issue(s)\t\r\n<!-- Link the issues being closed by or related to this PR.

Also mention which screens are going to have the changes if applicable -->\r\n- Send multiple audios in a single channel to test the play/pause/rate\r\n- Send audio in a thread \r\n    - The audio from a channel will pause when opening the thread\r\n    - If the audio from a thread is playing, then back to the channel, this audio from the thread should stop\r\n - Background listening\r\n - Check if screen is always on while playing an audio and if can go off after is paused\r\n - Play the audio from all clients origin on all clients Android/iOS/Web.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/5b139486-728c-4078-8f87-3ee0fe3aca22\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/01fdc54b-d7a5-461a-8cd1-e28e9b3f5855\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/d49c9fe7-0cb1-48de-bdca-6366963325e9\r\n\r\n\r\n#### With Sound\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/cdd0cd6f-c966-49fb-a6b1-99205ad7999a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!-- What types of changes does your code introduce to Rocket.Chat? -->\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Improvement (non-breaking change which improves a current function)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Documentation update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue below. -->\r\n\r\nI was working on this task that seemed straightforward at first: relabeling buttons. However, during the tests, we discovered that the 'unmuted' array handling for read-only rooms wasn't functioning correctly on mobile. Surprisingly, the 'unmuted' array wasn't even being saved in the local database. To fix this, we needed more than just label changes. We had to modify the database to handle the 'unmuted' array in the local database.\r\n\r\n## Issue(s)\t\r\n<!-- Link the issues being closed by or related to this PR. For example, you can use #594 if this PR closes issue number 594 -->\r\n\r\n## How to test or reproduce\r\n<!-- Mention how you would reproduce the bug if not mentioned on the issue page already. Also mention which screens are going to have the changes if applicable -->\r\n\r\n- Create a read-only channel and add one or a few users\r\n- unmute users  and try to send a message using them\r\n- then mute again and these users wouldn't be able to send a message again.\r\n- Also check the labels if they are the same as expected by the design\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n- At Desktop app, the user logged is the Reinaldo Neto. While on mobile is reinaldo123\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative/assets/47038980/3bfab004-665b-4568-9aa2-3a72aa28fbdf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!-- What types of changes does your code introduce to Rocket.Chat? -->\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Improvement (non-breaking change which improves a current function)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Documentation update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.
