                "body": "There are some small workarounds for this. You can't prevent `amplify push` from overwriting the template, but you can trick it to generate the stack you want, to some extent.\r\n\r\nI've found that adding to both `backend-config.json` and `amplify-meta.json` files some data manually (you need to duplicate it in both), and then running `amplify push --force`, makes several changes to the container stack. Specifically:\r\n\r\n## Add output parameters from another stack as input parameters\r\n\r\nYou need to update the `dependsOn` array and add the input parameters you want in the following format:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"category\": \"\",\r\n  \"resourceName\": <Name of your stack>,\r\n  \"attributes\": [\r\n    <Name of attribute 1>,\r\n    <Name of attribute 12>,\r\n    ...\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have a container-based API called `\"MyContainerApi\"` and a custom resource called `\"MyCustomResource\"` that outputs the attributes `\"CustomAttribute1\"` and `\"CustomAttribute2\"`, you `backend-config.json` and `amplify-meta.json` files will initially look similar to this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"api\": {\r\n    \"MyContainerApi\": {\r\n      \"apiType\": \"REST\",\r\n      \"build\": true,\r\n      \"dependsOn\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"attributes\": [\r\n            \"ClusterName\",\r\n            \"VpcId\",\r\n            \"VpcCidrBlock\",\r\n            \"SubnetIds\",\r\n            \"VpcLinkId\",\r\n            \"CloudMapNamespaceId\"\r\n          ],\r\n          \"category\": \"\",\r\n          \"resourceName\": \"NetworkStack\"\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"deploymentMechanism\": \"FULLY_MANAGED\",\r\n      \"iamAccessUnavailable\": true,\r\n      \"imageSource\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"CUSTOM\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"providerPlugin\": \"awscloudformation\",\r\n      \"resourceName\": \"graphql\",\r\n      \"restrictAccess\": false,\r\n      \"service\": \"ElasticContainer\",\r\n      \"skipHashing\": false\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"custom\": {\r\n    \"MyCustomResource\": {\r\n      \"dependsOn\": [],\r\n      \"providerPlugin\": \"awscloudformation\",\r\n      \"service\": \"customCloudformation\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the stack name for your custom resource will be something like `\"customMyCustomResource\"` (you can check the name on your root stack in CF). Then you need to add the following object to the `dependsOn` array of your API:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"category\": \"\",\r\n  \"resourceName\": \"customMyCustomResource\", // Name of the stack\r\n  \"attributes\": [\r\n    // Name of the output attributes you want to input\r\n    \"CustomAttribute1\",\r\n    \"CustomAttribute2\"\r\n  ],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the file ends up looking like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"api\": {\r\n    \"MyContainerApi\": {\r\n      \"apiType\": \"REST\",\r\n      \"build\": true,\r\n      \"dependsOn\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"attributes\": [\r\n            \"ClusterName\",\r\n            \"VpcId\",\r\n            \"VpcCidrBlock\",\r\n            \"SubnetIds\",\r\n            \"VpcLinkId\",\r\n            \"CloudMapNamespaceId\"\r\n          ],\r\n          \"category\": \"\",\r\n          \"resourceName\": \"NetworkStack\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"category\": \"\",\r\n          \"resourceName\": \"customMyCustomResource\",\r\n          \"attributes\": [\"CustomAttribute1\", \"CustomAttribute2\"]\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"deploymentMechanism\": \"FULLY_MANAGED\",\r\n      \"iamAccessUnavailable\": true,\r\n      \"imageSource\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"CUSTOM\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"providerPlugin\": \"awscloudformation\",\r\n      \"resourceName\": \"graphql\",\r\n      \"restrictAccess\": false,\r\n      \"service\": \"ElasticContainer\",\r\n      \"skipHashing\": false\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"custom\": {\r\n    \"MyCustomResource\": {\r\n      \"dependsOn\": [],\r\n      \"providerPlugin\": \"awscloudformation\",\r\n      \"service\": \"customCloudformation\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run `amplify push --force`, and you'll see the parameters in your API stack:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"customMyCustomResourceCustomAttribute1\": {\r\n  \"Type\": \"String\"\r\n},\r\n\"customMyCustomResourceCustomAttribute2\": {\r\n  \"Type\": \"String\"\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Using the parameters as environment variables for your container\r\n\r\nHaving the parameters is nice, but since you can't make any manual changes to the file, you can't really reference them, so they're kinda useless. I've discovered how to use them as environment variables for a container. You need to add the attribute `\"environmentMap\"` to your containerized API definition like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"environmentMap\": {\r\n    \"CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTE_1\": {\r\n      \"Ref\": \"customMyCustomResourceCustomAttribute1\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTE_2\": {\r\n      \"Ref\": \"customMyCustomResourceCustomAttribute2\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the final definition will be:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"api\": {\r\n    \"MyContainerApi\": {\r\n      \"apiType\": \"REST\",\r\n      \"build\": true,\r\n      \"dependsOn\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"attributes\": [\r\n            \"ClusterName\",\r\n            \"VpcId\",\r\n            \"VpcCidrBlock\",\r\n            \"SubnetIds\",\r\n            \"VpcLinkId\",\r\n            \"CloudMapNamespaceId\"\r\n          ],\r\n          \"category\": \"\",\r\n          \"resourceName\": \"NetworkStack\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"category\": \"\",\r\n          \"resourceName\": \"customMyCustomResource\",\r\n          \"attributes\": [\"CustomAttribute1\", \"CustomAttribute2\"]\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"environmentMap\": {\r\n        \"CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTE_1\": {\r\n          \"Ref\": \"customMyCustomResourceCustomAttribute1\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTE_2\": {\r\n          \"Ref\": \"customMyCustomResourceCustomAttribute2\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      \"deploymentMechanism\": \"FULLY_MANAGED\",\r\n      \"iamAccessUnavailable\": true,\r\n      \"imageSource\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"CUSTOM\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"providerPlugin\": \"awscloudformation\",\r\n      \"resourceName\": \"graphql\",\r\n      \"restrictAccess\": false,\r\n      \"service\": \"ElasticContainer\",\r\n      \"skipHashing\": false\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"custom\": {\r\n    \"MyCustomResource\": {\r\n      \"dependsOn\": [],\r\n      \"providerPlugin\": \"awscloudformation\",\r\n      \"service\": \"customCloudformation\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will see how the environment variables are created on your CF template, on the `containersDefinition` section of your Task:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"ContainerDefinitions\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"Command\": [],\r\n      \"EntryPoint\": [],\r\n      \"Environment\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"Name\": \"CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTE_1\",\r\n          \"Value\": {\r\n            \"Ref\": \"customMyCustomResourceCustomAttribute1\"\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"Name\": \"CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTE_2\",\r\n          \"Value\": {\r\n            \"Ref\": \"customMyCustomResourceCustomAttribute2\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      // ...rest of the container definition\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```",

To provide context, here's what I've attempted and the issues encountered:\r\n\r\n**Steps Taken:**\r\n\r\n- Created a development (dev) environment on Amplify using CLI commands and successfully deployed it.\r\n- Integrated authentication methods (email, Google, and Apple), a database (DB), storage, and a GraphQL API into the dev environment.\r\n- Using CLI commands, I created another environment called 'main'. During this setup, I was prompted to enter authentication-related settings (IDs and secrets), but Amplify did not yet contain any auth settings. Instead, only the team-provider-info.json had an entry for the 'main' environment.\r\n- Attempted to implement a CI/CD pipeline for automatic code promotion.\r\n- For the dev environment, I'm only pulling the Amplify configuration before creating an artifact, which I believe is the correct approach.\r\n- For the 'main' environment, my understanding is that I should first switch to the 'main' environment and then push the changes, expecting it to automatically include all the configurations from the dev environment.\r\n\r\n**Issues Encountered:**\r\n\r\n1. Initially, I tried changing the configuration to point to the 'main' environment using the 'amplify configure project' command, but this didn't work as expected.\r\n2. I attempted to use 'amplify init', but it asked for authentication configurations again, resulting in the error message, \"auth headless is missing the following input parameters: googleAppIdUserPool, googleAppSecretUserPool.\" I'm unsure how to specify these settings in addition to the existing Apple and email-based configurations.\r\n\r\n**Questions:**\r\n\r\n1. Is the approach I've outlined the correct one for my objectives? My goal is for developers to make changes in the 'dev' environment from their local workstations using the Amplify CLI, which should deploy changes to the 'dev' environment. When a pull request is merged from 'dev' to 'main', I want the CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy all the changes configured in the 'dev' environment to the 'main' environment, assuming that all settings (auth, storage, etc.) remain the same between these environments.\r\n2. Can you please guide me through the proper steps and provide sample code to achieve this objective?\r\n\r\nYour insights and assistance are highly appreciated. Thank you.",

Or at least where to look for better debugging information?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n** Provide additional details**\r\n",

Please describe the changes made.\n\nIAM roles for functions in the cloud for interacting with other AWS resources such as SNS topic publication.\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nAfter creating a python lambda, amplify-cli attempts to run it using `nodejs` backend when mocking. The created function has the correct python skeleton and deploys as a python3.8 backend. \n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`amplify mock function` should use the `python3.8` runtime and properly mock the function.\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\n1. `amplify create function`\r\n2. Select python run time options\r\n3. Do not update any special permissions\r\n4. `amplify mock function <function_name>`\n\n### Project Identifier\n\nProject Identifier: 5ed20e93d1463f6c86d9ee36980bc7ef\n\n### Log output\n\n<details>\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Put your logs below this line\r\n\r\n2023-10-20T00:11:16.509Z|info : amplify function mock snsGenerate \r\n2023-10-20T00:11:16.591Z|info : @aws-amplify/amplify-cli-core.banner-message/index.ts.fetch banner messages from https://aws-amplify.github.io/amplify-cli/banner-message.json({}\r\n2023-10-20T00:11:19.717Z|info : amplify-provider-awscloudformation.system-config-manager.getProfileConfig([\"vibe\"])\r\n2023-10-20T00:11:19.721Z|info : amplify-provider-awscloudformation.system-config-manager.getProfiledAwsConfig.profileConfig([{\"region\":\"us-east-1\"}])\r\n2023-10-20T00:11:19.722Z|info : amplify-provider-awscloudformation.system-config-manager.getProfileCredentials([\"vibe\"])\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\n\n### Additional information\n\nWhen running `amplify update function`, the output banner has the following information:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u279c amplify update function          \r\n? Select the Lambda function you want to update snsGenerate\r\nGeneral information\r\n- Name: snsGenerate\r\n- Runtime: nodejs\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce again, the function deploys and runs fine when deployed in the correct runtime. The relevant section of the cloudFormation json contains the correct runtime designation:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"Properties\": {\r\n        ...\r\n        \"Runtime\": \"python3.8\",\r\n        \"Layers\": [],\r\n        \"Timeout\": 25\r\n        ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI attempted a forced `amplify pull` hoping that would correct the configuration to no avail. \n\n### Before submitting, please confirm:\n\n\n- [X] I have done my best to include a minimal, self-contained set of instructions for consistently reproducing the issue.\n- [X] I have removed any sensitive information from my code snippets and submission.",

All is good and works. Then I want to set up a DocumentDB for data storage (I need Mongo compatibility, cannot do the default DynamoDB). I've created a custom resource with the stack that creates my cluster, my instances, and a secret in the Secrets Manager with the credentials. The stack outputs are the Cluster endpoint, Cluster port, and Secret ARN.\r\n\r\nI would like to inject these 3 values into my Fargate container as environment variables. Here's what I've tried so far:\r\n\r\n- Adding them as parameters to the API CF stack: not sure if it's possible. Can't do it through the CLI using the \"Access other resources\" option, and do not want to do it through the team-provider file because that would mean hardcoding the values, and that's not what I want.\r\n- Adding the Cluster, Instance, and Secret to the API stack as extra resources, so I can reference them directly. They get deleted every time I amplify push (I assume the stack gets regenerated from the docker-compose and overrides any changes I make).\r\n\r\nIs there anything else I can try?\r\n\r\nEdit: I've managed to inject the parameters into the stack by adding them to the `backend-config.json` and to the `amplify-meta.json`, into the `dependsOn` array, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"MyAPI\": {\r\n      \"apiType\": \"REST\",\r\n      \"build\": true,\r\n      \"dependsOn\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"attributes\": [\r\n            \"ClusterName\",\r\n            \"VpcId\",\r\n            \"VpcCidrBlock\",\r\n            \"SubnetIds\",\r\n            \"VpcLinkId\",\r\n            \"CloudMapNamespaceId\"\r\n          ],\r\n          \"category\": \"\",\r\n          \"resourceName\": \"NetworkStack\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"attributes\": [\r\n            \"ClusterEndpoint\",\r\n            \"ClusterPort\",\r\n            \"PasswordSecretArn\"\r\n          ],\r\n          \"category\": \"\",\r\n          \"resourceName\": \"customDatabase\"\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"deploymentMechanism\": \"FULLY_MANAGED\",\r\n      \"iamAccessUnavailable\": true,\r\n      \"imageSource\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"CUSTOM\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"providerPlugin\": \"awscloudformation\",\r\n      \"resourceName\": \"graphql\",\r\n      \"restrictAccess\": false,\r\n      \"service\": \"ElasticContainer\",\r\n      \"skipHashing\": false\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I have them in the CF stack:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"customDatabaseClusterEndpoint\": {\r\n      \"Type\": \"String\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"customDatabaseClusterPort\": {\r\n      \"Type\": \"String\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"customDatabasePasswordSecretArn\": {\r\n      \"Type\": \"String\"\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut every time I try to reference them from the container definition:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        \"ContainerDefinitions\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"Command\": [],\r\n            \"EntryPoint\": [],\r\n            \"Environment\": [\r\n              {\r\n                \"Name\": \"DB_ENDPOINT\",\r\n                \"Value\": {\r\n                  \"Ref\": \"customDatabaseClusterEndpoint\"\r\n                }\r\n              }\r\n            ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt gets overriden by the `amplify push` command",

All is good and works. Then I want to set up a DocumentDB for data storage (I need Mongo compatibility, cannot do the default DynamoDB). I've created a custom resource with the stack that creates my cluster, my instances, and a secret in the Secrets Manager with the credentials. The stack outputs are the Cluster endpoint, Cluster port, and Secret ARN.\r\n\r\nI would like to inject these 3 values into my Fargate container as environment variables. Here's what I've tried so far:\r\n\r\n- Adding them as parameters to the API CF stack: not sure if it's possible. Can't do it through the CLI using the \"Access other resources\" option, and do not want to do it through the team-provider file because that would mean hardcoding the values, and that's not what I want.\r\n- Adding the Cluster, Instance, and Secret to the API stack as extra resources, so I can reference them directly. They get deleted every time I amplify push (I assume the stack gets regenerated from the docker-compose and overrides any changes I make).\r\n\r\nIs there anything else I can try?\r\n\r\nEdit: I've managed to inject the parameters into the stack by adding them to the `backend-config.json` and to the `amplify-meta.json`, into the `dependsOn` array, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"MyAPI\": {\r\n      \"apiType\": \"REST\",\r\n      \"build\": true,\r\n      \"dependsOn\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"attributes\": [\r\n            \"ClusterName\",\r\n            \"VpcId\",\r\n            \"VpcCidrBlock\",\r\n            \"SubnetIds\",\r\n            \"VpcLinkId\",\r\n            \"CloudMapNamespaceId\"\r\n          ],\r\n          \"category\": \"\",\r\n          \"resourceName\": \"NetworkStack\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"attributes\": [\r\n            \"ClusterEndpoint\",\r\n            \"ClusterPort\",\r\n            \"PasswordSecretArn\"\r\n          ],\r\n          \"category\": \"\",\r\n          \"resourceName\": \"customDatabase\"\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"deploymentMechanism\": \"FULLY_MANAGED\",\r\n      \"iamAccessUnavailable\": true,\r\n      \"imageSource\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"CUSTOM\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"providerPlugin\": \"awscloudformation\",\r\n      \"resourceName\": \"graphql\",\r\n      \"restrictAccess\": false,\r\n      \"service\": \"ElasticContainer\",\r\n      \"skipHashing\": false\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I have them in the CF stack:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"customDatabaseClusterEndpoint\": {\r\n      \"Type\": \"String\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"customDatabaseClusterPort\": {\r\n      \"Type\": \"String\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"customDatabasePasswordSecretArn\": {\r\n      \"Type\": \"String\"\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut every time I try to reference them from the container definition:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        \"ContainerDefinitions\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"Command\": [],\r\n            \"EntryPoint\": [],\r\n            \"Environment\": [\r\n              {\r\n                \"Name\": \"DB_ENDPOINT\",\r\n                \"Value\": {\r\n                  \"Ref\": \"customDatabaseClusterEndpoint\"\r\n                }\r\n              }\r\n            ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt gets overriden by the `amplify push` command",

To provide context, here's what I've attempted and the issues encountered:\r\n\r\n**Steps Taken:**\r\n\r\n- Created a development (dev) environment on Amplify using CLI commands and successfully deployed it.\r\n- Integrated authentication methods (email, Google, and Apple), a database (DB), storage, and a GraphQL API into the dev environment.\r\n- Using CLI commands, I created another environment called 'main'. During this setup, I was prompted to enter authentication-related settings (IDs and secrets), but Amplify did not yet contain any auth settings. Instead, only the team-provider-info.json had an entry for the 'main' environment.\r\n- Attempted to implement a CI/CD pipeline for automatic code promotion.\r\n- For the dev environment, I'm only pulling the Amplify configuration before creating an artifact, which I believe is the correct approach.\r\n- For the 'main' environment, my understanding is that I should first switch to the 'main' environment and then push the changes, expecting it to automatically include all the configurations from the dev environment.\r\n\r\n**Issues Encountered:**\r\n\r\n1. Initially, I tried changing the configuration to point to the 'main' environment using the 'amplify configure project' command, but this didn't work as expected.\r\n2. I attempted to use 'amplify init', but it asked for authentication configurations again, resulting in the error message, \"auth headless is missing the following input parameters: googleAppIdUserPool, googleAppSecretUserPool.\" I'm unsure how to specify these settings in addition to the existing Apple and email-based configurations.\r\n\r\n**Questions:**\r\n\r\n1. Is the approach I've outlined the correct one for my objectives? My goal is for developers to make changes in the 'dev' environment from their local workstations using the Amplify CLI, which should deploy changes to the 'dev' environment. When a pull request is merged from 'dev' to 'main', I want the CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy all the changes configured in the 'dev' environment to the 'main' environment, assuming that all settings (auth, storage, etc.) remain the same between these environments.\r\n2. Can you please guide me through the proper steps and provide sample code to achieve this objective?\r\n\r\nYour insights and assistance are highly appreciated. Thank you.",

It appears the application has Amplify Studio enabled and is prompting to authenticate on the browser. \r\n\r\nTo mitigate the issue we utilize the following options.\r\n\r\n1.

On re-running the pull command, this should automatically switch to using profiles.\r\n\r\n2. Using headless command and pass in additional attributes:\r\nWe can utilize a script to run Amplify CLI headless command that will use the profile or keys.
