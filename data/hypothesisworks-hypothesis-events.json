How about `integers().filter(partial(gt, 10)).filter(partial(lt, 20))`?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHow should we handle constraints that are incompatible with each other/with the annotated type? e.g. `Annotated[int, Gt(1), Lt(1)]`, `Annotated[str, Gt(1)]`? Should we ignore and let a potential error be raised at some point when the resulting strategy is used?\r\n",

We've considered this a few times before, and decided not to include it for reasons including:\r\n\r\n- individual decorators are much easier for tools to work with, whether that's typecheckers or Hypothesis' own patch-dumping logic\r\n- there are a couple of reasonable API designs - passing tuples or dicts of arguments is more convenient but doesn't support xfail or via methods; passing a sequence of decorator objects begs the question of why you're wrapping them\r\n- every new feature we support is a cognitive burden on all our users, especially learners.  We strongly prefer to have as small and orthogonal an interface as we can.\r\n- it's easy to implement this downstream, as a helper function in your own tests: eg https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/67a91f78e4395148afcc33e5cd6f3f0a9623e63a/Lib/test/test_zoneinfo/test_zoneinfo_property.py#L73-L100",

This might be a nonissue, as the current code only runs when there is no other trace function (read: coverage.py isn't running) anyway, so we could add a check for tool id 2 being free and call it a day. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could choose an unreserved tool ID, and gain the ability to run scrutineer at the same time as coverage.py. I'm not actually sure whether this is desired, however.\r\n\r\n[^1]: unless they choose not to use ID 2, but I can't imagine why they wouldn't.",

                "body": "The docs for `register_type_strategy` say that instead of registering `tuple[int]`, I can register `tuple` with a function that takes the type and return the strategy. I may be misunderstanding, but I take this to mean that I can register\r\n`st.register_type_strategy(tuple, lambda typ: foo)`\r\nand then `foo` should be the default strategy for _any_ param of type tuple, or `tuple[int]`, or `tuple[....]`, etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, the code below results in a test failure, and from my investigation it is clear that the registration is not effective, and that `test` is getting any old `tuple[int]` rather than using the strategy that was registered.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom hypothesis import given, strategies as st\r\n\r\n# Note that I'm not actually using the typ param here, but I do use it in my actual code\r\nst.register_type_strategy(tuple, lambda typ: st.tuples(st.integers(min_value=0)))\r\n\r\n@given(x=...)\r\ndef test(x: tuple[int]):\r\n    assert x[0] >= 0\r\n\r\ntest()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I'm using this correctly or if I understand the correct behavior. Is it simply impossible to register a default strategy for tuples that will work on parameterized tuples? If so, the documentation seems to suggest otherwise to me. Also, this seems like a useful feature to have. Or, is it that I am doing something wrong?\r\n\r\nThanks!",

I may be misunderstanding, but I take this to mean that I can register\r\n`st.register_type_strategy(tuple, lambda typ: foo)`\r\nand then `foo` should be the default strategy for _any_ param of type tuple, or `tuple[int]`, or `tuple[....]`, etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, the code below results in a test failure, and from my investigation it is clear that the registration is not effective, and that `test` is getting any old `tuple[int]` rather than using the strategy that was registered.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom hypothesis import given, strategies as st\r\n\r\n# Note that I'm not actually using the typ param here, but I do use it in my actual code\r\nst.register_type_strategy(tuple, lambda typ: st.tuples(st.integers(min_value=0)))\r\n\r\n@given(x=...)\r\ndef test(x: tuple[int]):\r\n    assert x[0] >= 0\r\n\r\ntest()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I'm using this correctly or if I understand the correct behavior. Is it simply impossible to register a default strategy for tuples that will work on parameterized tuples? If so, the documentation seems to suggest otherwise to me. Also, this seems like a useful feature to have. Or, is it that I am doing something wrong?\r\n\r\nThanks!",

Is it simply impossible to register a default strategy for tuples that will work on parameterized tuples? If so, the documentation seems to suggest otherwise to me. Also, this seems like a useful feature to have. Or, is it that I am doing something wrong?\r\n\r\nThanks!",

                "body": "Ok, sorry for all the churn in the other pull request https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/pull/3762 , I see now that we only need to change logic in `from_typing_type` as you had originally suggested. Having looked at that a bit, it seems that tuples are already pre-registered:\r\nhttps://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/blob/f73dab79a02a3b1bffdec3668a194d6da692147c/hypothesis-python/src/hypothesis/strategies/_internal/types.py?plain=1#L506\r\n\r\nSo if we just check whether they are registered, and go with whatever is registered, prior to the normal tuple logic (which does stuff like `st.tuples(*map(st.from_type, elem_types))`), then we will always skip the normal tuple logic in favor of what will usually just be `st.builds(tuple)` which I think equates to `()` every time.\r\n\r\n- Maybe we could delete the pre-registration? I'm not sure why the pre-registration is there, but I assume it's there for some important reason.\r\n- Maybe we try to distinguish between the pre-registration and a user-defined registration? An ugly way to do this is to just look at what is registered and if it looks like `st.builds(tuple)` then we don't use it and go along with the normal tuple special case logic. But that seems like an error prone way to handle it. But I can't think of a reasonable way to distinguish - fundamentally, it seems like registration involves the user overriding whatever logic would normally be used to handle a type, which makes it fundamentally different from whatever the pre-registration is doing, because pre-registration should probably defer to the special-case handling (which is what seems to be happening in the current codebase). Perhaps the pre-registration could be separated from user registration, somehow, but the scope of that change seems pretty large compared to this particular issue.",
