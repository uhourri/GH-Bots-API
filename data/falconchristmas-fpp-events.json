(Steps at end) \r\n# Please answer the following:\r\n**FPP Version and Hardware**: \r\nFPP 6.3.2 and 7.2.2 running on RPi 3B+\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug and Steps to reproduce**: \r\n1. In advanced system settings, set Scheduler max timeframe to schedule out to 3 months\r\n2. Create a test schedule with Start Date = today's date, End date to defualt 2028-12-31, Days to Even or Odd\r\n3. Start time 3pm to stop 4pm, some test playlist, loop immediately (these don't seem to matter)\r\n4. Save the new schedule, reload schedules then open the preview.\r\n5. Even/odd day schedules stop showing in the preview past about 30 days or so into the future from the current date.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**: \r\nPreview should show even/odd day schedules out to Jan 2024 because of the 3 month scheduler max timeframe set.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**: \r\nAll other days settings in the scheduler seem to work OK and the preview correctly shows them scheduled out to Jan 2024. I do not know if this is just a previewer issue or they really are not scheduled properly, I first found this on FPP 6.3.2 then tried 7.2.2 to see if it still exists. Had no issues with even/odd scheduling last year using FPP 5.5.\r\n\r\nIf I try a future state date for the odd/even schedule, like Nov. 23, 2023 (Thanksgiving eveniing) then nothing shows up in the preview and it says nothing is scheduled.\r\n\r\n**Additional Attachments**\r\n7.2.2 logs attached.\r\n\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\nScreen shots attached.\r\n[FPP_Logs_20231022.0022.zip](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/files/13062115/FPP_Logs_20231022.0022.zip)\r\n![Everyday Preview correct](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/acb3945a-e2d3-4e46-b775-c853721ac291)\r\n![Everyday Schedule](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/aca4d1bb-4d97-46d0-b5ff-b2cc62b91249)\r\n![Odd Preview](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/92bf8038-4c25-4e7a-a36a-68d779c31d86)\r\n![Odd Schedule](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/1a1fb59e-ab2b-4bd0-a1d7-0f9f3c60a438)\r\n![Even Preview](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/8c63f88e-0733-484f-a253-07f80dbbf6c8)\r\n![Even Schedule](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/31b89b85-684f-47cb-bdfd-9e32cc1ba5d4)\r\n![Advanced Settings](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/8a2ff358-9dfd-42ed-8494-4f670d4265a5)\r\n![2023-09-23 (8)](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/2b9baf39-18f5-4230-8ede-c773bcac134c)\r\n![Future Start Error](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/49353358-5717-432d-82f1-cbea8e66e457)\r\n",

(Steps at end) \r\n# Please answer the following:\r\n**FPP Version and Hardware**: \r\nFPP 6.3.2 and 7.2.2 running on RPi 3B+\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug and Steps to reproduce**: \r\n1. In advanced system settings, set Scheduler max timeframe to schedule out to 3 months\r\n2. Create a test schedule with Start Date = today's date, End date to defualt 2028-12-31, Days to Even or Odd\r\n3. Start time 3pm to stop 4pm, some test playlist, loop immediately (these don't seem to matter)\r\n4. Save the new schedule, reload schedules then open the preview.\r\n5. Even/odd day schedules stop showing in the preview past about 30 days or so into the future from the current date.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**: \r\nPreview should show even/odd day schedules out to Jan 2024 because of the 3 month scheduler max timeframe set.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**: \r\nAll other days settings in the scheduler seem to work OK and the preview correctly shows them scheduled out to Jan 2024. I do not know if this is just a previewer issue or they really are not scheduled properly, I first found this on FPP 6.3.2 then tried 7.2.2 to see if it still exists. Had no issues with even/odd scheduling last year using FPP 5.5.\r\n\r\nIf I try a future state date for the odd/even schedule, like Nov. 23, 2023 (Thanksgiving eveniing) then nothing shows up in the preview and it says nothing is scheduled.\r\n\r\n**Additional Attachments**\r\n7.2.2 logs attached.\r\n\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\nScreen shots attached.\r\n[FPP_Logs_20231022.0022.zip](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/files/13062115/FPP_Logs_20231022.0022.zip)\r\n![Everyday Preview correct](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/acb3945a-e2d3-4e46-b775-c853721ac291)\r\n![Everyday Schedule](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/aca4d1bb-4d97-46d0-b5ff-b2cc62b91249)\r\n![Odd Preview](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/92bf8038-4c25-4e7a-a36a-68d779c31d86)\r\n![Odd Schedule](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/1a1fb59e-ab2b-4bd0-a1d7-0f9f3c60a438)\r\n![Even Preview](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/8c63f88e-0733-484f-a253-07f80dbbf6c8)\r\n![Even Schedule](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/31b89b85-684f-47cb-bdfd-9e32cc1ba5d4)\r\n![Advanced Settings](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/8a2ff358-9dfd-42ed-8494-4f670d4265a5)\r\n![2023-09-23 (8)](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/2b9baf39-18f5-4230-8ede-c773bcac134c)\r\n![Future Start Error](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/49353358-5717-432d-82f1-cbea8e66e457)\r\n",

(Steps at end) \r\n# Please answer the following:\r\n**FPP Version and Hardware**: \r\nFPP 6.3.2 and 7.2.2 running on RPi 3B+\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug and Steps to reproduce**: \r\n1. In advanced system settings, set Scheduler max timeframe to schedule out to 3 months\r\n2. Create a test schedule with Start Date = today's date, End date to defualt 2028-12-31, Days to Even or Odd\r\n3. Start time 3pm to stop 4pm, some test playlist, loop immediately (these don't seem to matter)\r\n4. Save the new schedule, reload schedules then open the preview.\r\n5. Even day schedules stop at Nov 18 and odd ones stop at Nov 19 2023.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**: \r\nPreview should show even/odd day schedules out to Jan 2024 because of the 3 month scheduler max timeframe set.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**: \r\nAll other days settings in the scheduler seem to work OK and the preview correctly shows them scheduled out to Jan 2024. I do not know if this is just a previewer issue or they really are not scheduled properly, I first found this on FPP 6.3.2 then tried 7.2.2 to see if it still exists. Had no issues with even/odd scheduling last year using FPP 5.5.\r\n\r\nIf I try a future state date for the odd/even schedule, like Nov. 23, 2023 (Thanksgiving eveniing) then nothing shows up in the preview and it says nothing is scheduled.\r\n\r\n**Additional Attachments**\r\n7.2.2 logs attached.\r\n\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\nScreen shots attached.\r\n[FPP_Logs_20231022.0022.zip](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/files/13062115/FPP_Logs_20231022.0022.zip)\r\n![Everyday Preview correct](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/acb3945a-e2d3-4e46-b775-c853721ac291)\r\n![Everyday Schedule](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/aca4d1bb-4d97-46d0-b5ff-b2cc62b91249)\r\n![Odd Preview](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/92bf8038-4c25-4e7a-a36a-68d779c31d86)\r\n![Odd Schedule](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/1a1fb59e-ab2b-4bd0-a1d7-0f9f3c60a438)\r\n![Even Preview](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/8c63f88e-0733-484f-a253-07f80dbbf6c8)\r\n![Even Schedule](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/31b89b85-684f-47cb-bdfd-9e32cc1ba5d4)\r\n![Advanced Settings](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/8a2ff358-9dfd-42ed-8494-4f670d4265a5)\r\n![2023-09-23 (8)](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/2b9baf39-18f5-4230-8ede-c773bcac134c)\r\n![Future Start Error](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/49353358-5717-432d-82f1-cbea8e66e457)\r\n",

Fresh install of FPP 7.2 on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2\r\n2. Upload several MP4 Video Files. In this case I was using files from AtmosFX designed for pumpkin projection. (Jack-o-Lantern Jamboree)\r\n3. Create a playlist of several different MP4 files.\r\n4. Manually start the playlist with the 'Repeat' option selected.\r\n5. After a few minutes of repeating files, the audio cuts out but the video continues to play.\r\n6. The video ends on the last frame of the video.\r\n7. Logging in to FPP shows that FPPD has crashed. Clicking Start FPPD or Restart FPPD  does not work in this case and the only way to start FPPD again is to reboot from the web interface or a hard reboot by cutting power.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**: \r\nThe playlist will continue to cycle through the MP4 files without issue.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**: \r\nAttached are log files that were written during the crash. The audio cut out at around timing 19:13:35 in the log file. Date: 10-20-2023. This was confirmed by using 2 separate Raspberry Pi Zero 2's with the same result. This is with a brand new fresh install of FPP 7.2 on a new SD Card.\r\n\r\n**Additional Attachments**\r\nAttached is a full log in 'Excessive' mode while completing the steps above.\r\n\r\n[FPP_Logs_20231020.2315 (1).zip](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/files/13110575/FPP_Logs_20231020.2315.1.zip)\r\n",

I would just play a video from the main status page and click repeat. After it ended, a crash log was generated. I got around that issue by making a playlist of 2 videos and having the playlist repeat. Since I was able to get around that, I figured this was a separate issue. ",

Fresh install of FPP 7.2 on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2\r\n2. Upload several MP4 Video Files. In this case I was using files from AtmosFX designed for pumpkin projection. (Jack-o-Lantern Jamboree)\r\n3. Create a playlist of several different MP4 files.\r\n4. Manually start the playlist with the 'Repeat' option selected.\r\n5. After a few minutes of repeating files, the audio cuts out but the video continues to play.\r\n6. The video ends on the last frame of the video.\r\n7. Logging in to FPP shows that FPPD has crashed. Clicking Start FPPD or Restart FPPD  does not work in this case and the only way to start FPPD again is to reboot from the web interface or a hard reboot by cutting power.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**: \r\nThe playlist will continue to cycle through the MP4 files without issue.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**: \r\nAttached are log files that were written during the crash. The audio cut out at around timing 19:13:35 in the log file. Date: 10-20-2023. This was confirmed by using 2 separate Raspberry Pi Zero 2's with the same result. This is with a brand new fresh install of FPP 7.2 on a new SD Card.\r\n\r\n**Additional Attachments**\r\nAttached is a full log in 'Excessive' mode while completing the steps above.\r\n\r\n[FPP_Logs_20231020.2315 (1).zip](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/files/13110575/FPP_Logs_20231020.2315.1.zip)\r\n",

Fresh install of FPP 7.2 on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2\r\n2. Upload several MP4 Video Files. In this case I was using files from AtmosFX designed for pumpkin projection. (Jack-o-Lantern Jamboree)\r\n3. Create a playlist of several different MP4 files.\r\n4. Manually start the playlist with the 'Repeat' option selected.\r\n5. After a few minutes of repeating files, the audio cuts out but the video continues to play.\r\n6. The video ends on the last frame of the video.\r\n7. Logging in to FPP shows that FPPD has crashed. Clicking Start FPPD or Restart FPPD  does not work in this case and the only way to start FPPD again is to reboot from the web interface or a hard reboot by cutting power.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**: \r\nThe playlist will continue to cycle through the MP4 files without issue.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**: \r\nAttached are log files that were written during the crash. The audio cut out at around timing 19:13:35 in the log file. Date: 10-20-2023. This was confirmed by using 2 separate Raspberry Pi Zero 2's with the same result. This is with a brand new fresh install of FPP 7.2 on a new SD Card.\r\n\r\n**Additional Attachments**\r\nAttached is a full log in 'Excessive' mode while completing the steps above.\r\n\r\n[FPP_Logs_20231020.2315 (1).zip](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/files/13110575/FPP_Logs_20231020.2315.1.zip)\r\n",

Fresh install of FPP 7.2 on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2\r\n2. Upload several MP4 Video Files. In this case I was using files from AtmosFX designed for pumpkin projection. (Jack-o-Lantern Jamboree)\r\n3. Create a playlist of several different MP4 files.\r\n4. Manually start the playlist with the 'Repeat' option selected.\r\n5. After a few minutes of repeating files, the audio cuts out but the video continues to play.\r\n6. The video ends on the last frame of the video.\r\n7. Logging in to FPP shows that FPPD has crashed. Clicking Start FPPD or Restart FPPD  does not work in this case and the only way to start FPPD again is to reboot from the web interface or a hard reboot by cutting power.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**: \r\nThe playlist will continue to cycle through the MP4 files without issue.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**: \r\nAttached are log files that were written during the crash. The audio cut out at around timing 19:13:35 in the log file. Date: 10-20-2023. This was confirmed by using 2 separate Raspberry Pi Zero 2's with the same result. This is with a brand new fresh install of FPP 7.2 on a new SD Card.\r\n\r\n**Additional Attachments**\r\nAttached is a full log in 'Excessive' mode while completing the steps above.\r\n\r\n[FPP_Logs_20231020.2315 (1).zip](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/files/13110575/FPP_Logs_20231020.2315.1.zip)\r\n",

This button is very similar to the mp3gain button but instead it will extract the audio from the video and place it in the Audio folder.\r\n\r\nThe appropriate tool, ffmpeg, is already built into FPP so no other utilities need to be installed.  The syntax for ffmpeg to do this is below.\r\n\r\n`ffmpeg -i INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_FILE.mp3` \r\n\r\nThe above is reasonable defaults but the audio will always be re-encoded.  The various Pi & BBB based boards can handle this task without issue.\r\n\r\nPossible enhancements to the above could be below but it's really not needed\r\n* Logic to detect if the source codec is already mp3 and if so put `-c copy` between the INPUT_FILE and OUTPUT_FILE and nothing will be re-encoded and only file io is used.\r\n  * Another option is to try to do the `-c copy` option first and check the exit code of ffmpeg.  If it fails then run the convert method.\r\n* Option to run mp3gain after extraction\r\n\r\nNote, I already tried to write the feature myself but did not have success.  I modified upload.php in /opt/fpp/www duplicating the mp3gain stuff in the Videos section, duplicating the function and duplicated run_mp3gain.php.    After adding this section none of the files would show up in the File Manager\r\n\r\n``` php\r\n<? if (file_exists(\"/bin/ffmpeg\") || file_exists(\"/usr/bin/ffmpeg\") || file_exists(\"/opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg\") || file_exists(\"/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg\")) { ?>\r\n    <input onclick=\"ButtonHandler('Videos', 'extractAudio');\" id=\"btnExtractAudio\" class=\"disableButtons singleVideosButton multiVideosButton\" type=\"button\"  value=\"Extract Audio\" />\r\n<? } ?>\r\n```\r\n",

This button is very similar to the mp3gain button but instead it will extract the audio from the video and place it in the Audio folder.\r\n\r\nThe appropriate tool, ffmpeg, is already built into FPP so no other utilities need to be installed.  The syntax for ffmpeg to do this is below.\r\n\r\n`ffmpeg -i INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_FILE.mp3` \r\n\r\nThe above is reasonable defaults but the audio will always be re-encoded.  The various Pi & BBB based boards can handle this task without issue.\r\n\r\nPossible enhancements to the above could be below but it's really not needed\r\n* Logic to detect if the source codec is already mp3 and if so put `-c copy` between the INPUT_FILE and OUTPUT_FILE and nothing will be re-encoded and only file io is used.\r\n  * Another option is to try to do the `-c copy` option first and check the exit code of ffmpeg.  If it fails then run the convert method.\r\n* Option to run mp3gain after extraction\r\n\r\nNote, I already tried to write the feature myself but did not have success.  I modified upload.php in /opt/fpp/www duplicating the mp3gain stuff in the Videos section, duplicating the function and duplicated run_mp3gain.php.    After adding this section none of the files would show up in the File Manager\r\n\r\n``` php\r\n<? if (file_exists(\"/bin/ffmpeg\") || file_exists(\"/usr/bin/ffmpeg\") || file_exists(\"/opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg\") || file_exists(\"/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg\")) { ?>\r\n    <input onclick=\"ButtonHandler('Videos', 'extractAudio');\" id=\"btnExtractAudio\" class=\"disableButtons singleVideosButton multiVideosButton\" type=\"button\"  value=\"Extract Audio\" />\r\n<? } ?>\r\n```\r\n",

                "body": "**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA button on the Videos tab labeled \"Extract Audio\".  This button is very similar to the mp3gain button but instead it will extract the audio from the video and place it in the Audio folder.\r\n\r\nThe appropriate tool, ffmpeg, is already built into FPP so no other utilities need to be installed.  The syntax for ffmpeg to do this is below.\r\n\r\n`ffmpeg -i INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_FILE.mp3` \r\n\r\nThe above is reasonable defaults but the audio will always be re-encoded.  The various Pi & BBB based boards can handle this task without issue.\r\n\r\nPossible enhancements to the above could be below but it's really not needed\r\n* Logic to detect if the source codec is already mp3 and if so put `-c copy` between the INPUT_FILE and OUTPUT_FILE and nothing will be re-encoded and only file io is used.\r\n  * Another option is to try to do the `-c copy` option first and check the exit code of ffmpeg.  If it fails then run the convert method.\r\n* Option to run mp3gain after extraction\r\n\r\nNote, I already tried to write the feature myself but did not have success.  I modified upload.php in /opt/fpp/www duplicating the mp3gain stuff in the Videos section, duplicating the function and duplicated run_mp3gain.php.    After adding this section none of the files would show up in the File Manager\r\n\r\n``` php\r\n<? if (file_exists(\"/bin/ffmpeg\") || file_exists(\"/usr/bin/ffmpeg\") || file_exists(\"/opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg\") || file_exists(\"/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg\")) { ?>\r\n    <input onclick=\"ButtonHandler('Videos', 'extractAudio');\" id=\"btnExtractAudio\" class=\"disableButtons singleVideosButton multiVideosButton\" type=\"button\"  value=\"Extract Audio\" />\r\n<? } ?>\r\n```\r\n",

(Steps at end) \r\n# Please answer the following:\r\n**FPP Version and Hardware**: \r\nFPP 6.3.2 and 7.2.2 running on RPi 3B+\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug and Steps to reproduce**: \r\n1. In advanced system settings, set Scheduler max timeframe to schedule out to 3 months\r\n2. Create a test schedule with Start Date = today's date, End date to defualt 2028-12-31, Days to Even or Odd\r\n3. Start time 3pm to stop 4pm, some test playlist, loop immediately (these don't seem to matter)\r\n4. Save the new schedule, reload schedules then open the preview.\r\n5. Even day schedules stop at Nov 18 and odd ones stop at Nov 19 2023.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**: \r\nPreview should show even/odd day schedules out to Jan 2024 because of the 3 month scheduler max timeframe set.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**: \r\nAll other days settings in the scheduler seem to work OK and the preview correctly shows them scheduled out to Jan 2024. I do not know if this is just a previewer issue or they really are not scheduled properly, I first found this on FPP 6.3.2 then tried 7.2.2 to see if it still exists. Had no issues with even/odd scheduling last year using FPP 5.5.\r\n\r\nIf I try a future state date for the odd/even schedule, like Nov. 23, 2023 (Thanksgiving eveniing) then nothing shows up in the preview and it says nothing is scheduled.\r\n\r\n**Additional Attachments**\r\n7.2.2 logs attached.\r\n\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\nScreen shots attached.\r\n[FPP_Logs_20231022.0022.zip](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/files/13062115/FPP_Logs_20231022.0022.zip)\r\n![Everyday Preview correct](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/acb3945a-e2d3-4e46-b775-c853721ac291)\r\n![Everyday Schedule](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/aca4d1bb-4d97-46d0-b5ff-b2cc62b91249)\r\n![Odd Preview](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/92bf8038-4c25-4e7a-a36a-68d779c31d86)\r\n![Odd Schedule](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/1a1fb59e-ab2b-4bd0-a1d7-0f9f3c60a438)\r\n![Even Preview](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/8c63f88e-0733-484f-a253-07f80dbbf6c8)\r\n![Even Schedule](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/31b89b85-684f-47cb-bdfd-9e32cc1ba5d4)\r\n![Advanced Settings](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/8a2ff358-9dfd-42ed-8494-4f670d4265a5)\r\n![2023-09-23 (8)](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/2b9baf39-18f5-4230-8ede-c773bcac134c)\r\n![Future Start Error](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/49353358-5717-432d-82f1-cbea8e66e457)\r\n",

I see Playlist A & B alternating everyday as expected, but both stop on Nov18 (even) and Nov 19 (odd) in the preview. Same as I got yesterday. Then I added a third schedule starting today set to everyday running Playlist_C from 5pm to 6pm. The preview does expand to the full 3 months, but looking carefully, Playlist A & B still stop on Nov 18/19. Playlist_C continues on by itself for the rest of the preview out to 3 months. I have not found a combination yet where odd/even schedules run past Nov 19. At least not shown in the preview.",

(Steps at end) \r\n# Please answer the following:\r\n**FPP Version and Hardware**: \r\nFPP 6.3.2 and 7.2.2 running on RPi 3B+\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug and Steps to reproduce**: \r\n1. In advanced system settings, set Scheduler max timeframe to schedule out to 3 months\r\n2. Create a test schedule with Start Date = today's date, End date to defualt 2028-12-31, Days to Even or Odd\r\n3. Start time 3pm to stop 4pm, some test playlist, loop immediately (these don't seem to matter)\r\n4. Save the new schedule, reload schedules then open the preview.\r\n5. Even day schedules stop at Nov 18 and odd ones stop at Nov 19 2023.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**: \r\nPreview should show even/odd day schedules out to Jan 2024 because of the 3 month scheduler max timeframe set.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**: \r\nAll other days settings in the scheduler seem to work OK and the preview correctly shows them scheduled out to Jan 2024. I do not know if this is just a previewer issue or they really are not scheduled properly, I first found this on FPP 6.3.2 then tried 7.2.2 to see if it still exists. Had no issues with even/odd scheduling last year using FPP 5.5.\r\n\r\nIf I try a future state date for the odd/even schedule, like Nov. 23, 2023 (Thanksgiving eveniing) then nothing shows up in the preview and it says nothing is scheduled.\r\n\r\n**Additional Attachments**\r\n7.2.2 logs attached.\r\n\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\nScreen shots attached.\r\n[FPP_Logs_20231022.0022.zip](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/files/13062115/FPP_Logs_20231022.0022.zip)\r\n![Everyday Preview correct](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/acb3945a-e2d3-4e46-b775-c853721ac291)\r\n![Everyday Schedule](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/aca4d1bb-4d97-46d0-b5ff-b2cc62b91249)\r\n![Odd Preview](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/92bf8038-4c25-4e7a-a36a-68d779c31d86)\r\n![Odd Schedule](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/1a1fb59e-ab2b-4bd0-a1d7-0f9f3c60a438)\r\n![Even Preview](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/8c63f88e-0733-484f-a253-07f80dbbf6c8)\r\n![Even Schedule](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/31b89b85-684f-47cb-bdfd-9e32cc1ba5d4)\r\n![Advanced Settings](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/8a2ff358-9dfd-42ed-8494-4f670d4265a5)\r\n![2023-09-23 (8)](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/2b9baf39-18f5-4230-8ede-c773bcac134c)\r\n![Future Start Error](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/assets/9982279/49353358-5717-432d-82f1-cbea8e66e457)\r\n",
