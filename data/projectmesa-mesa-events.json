I think it would be annoying to handle multiple collectors and in terms of performance we probably end up iterating over all agents multiple times, which isn't ideal. \n\nI think a filter function can be useful for memory constraint environments (as we have witnessed before), but I don't think this is in contrast to your previous proposal, but rather additive. \n\nAlso both ideas revolve around syntactic sugar for our function reporter. Both collect-by-class and filter could be used as a function:\n\n```python\ndef reporter(agent):\n    if isinstance(agent, SomeClass) and agent.value > 5:\n        return agent.something\n```\n\nBut I think the last proposal has a very explicit and intuitive interface for this",

Wondering if there was logical reason or if someone remembered why? I was thinking we should get rid of HexGrid or make it private. \r\n\r\nSee the following two lines -https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/blob/b2f642fd1a986f3114ba6f6f6e9bc119c037062f/mesa/space.py#L742\r\nhttps://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/blob/b2f642fd1a986f3114ba6f6f6e9bc119c037062f/mesa/space.py#L768</div>",

Currently, agent reporters get their agents hard-coded from model.scheduler.agents, assuming it exists and failing if your scheduler is named differently. One way to fix this would be to (optionally?) supply the scheduler to the DataCollector.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that if you have agents that are not part of any schedule you still can't collect data for them. That's already a problem right now, so it wouldn't worsen the situation, but maybe someone has a better long-term solution to this?\r\n\r\nAlso, if you use the same scheduler, there seems to be no way to collect data from _different_ agents. If you for example want to count the wealth of some of your agents, but not all agents have a wealth attribute, it fails. ",

Because now it's like this one \"do it all\" object, collecting multiple variables from both models and agents.\r\n\r\nAside from the current two layers:\r\n\r\n- variables\r\n- model / agent\r\n\r\nWe kind of want to add a third and maybe forth layer\r\n- agent type\r\n- model/agent filter\r\n\r\nSo in the most extended form, there is one datacollector object that can handle all those layers.\r\n\r\nIn the smallest form, a datacollector collects one variable from one object.\r\n\r\nCurrently it's a bit in between. So I think the best question is: What is the optimal size of the datacollector object.\r\n\r\nOther form is that you do allow multiple variables, but only from one object type.\r\n\r\n```Python\r\ndc1 = mesa.DataCollector(reporters={\"number_of_sheep\": \"number_of_sheep\"}, target=WolfSheepModel, filter=None)\r\ndc2 = mesa.DataCollector(reporters={\"energy\": \"energy\"}, target=Sheep, filter=None)\r\ndc3 = mesa.DataCollector(reporters={\"energy\": \"energy\", \"prey_eaten\": \"prey_eaten\"}, target=Wolf, filter=\"prey_eaten\">5)\r\n```\r\nIf you assume a datacollector always collects from only one Class (so either one Model or one Agent), it gives some kinds of consistency and modularity, instead of sometimes having multiple classes it collects data from and sometimes one.\r\n\r\nBecause let's be honest, currently you already do.\r\n```Python\r\nmodel_vars = data_collector.get_model_vars_dataframe()\r\nagent_vars = data_collector.get_agent_vars_dataframe()\r\n```\r\nSo it already feels like different things.\r\n\r\nThen we could write some functions and methods to conveniently run and merge these, etc.",

                "body": "> Could you work out a bit more detailed proposal with some usage examples?\r\n\r\nIt's rather brief.\r\n```python\r\n# Filter based on class, as in Wolf-Sheep\r\ndc_wolf = mesa.DataCollector(agent_reporters=..., agent_filter=lambda a: isinstance(a, Wolf))\r\ndc_sheep = mesa.DataCollector(agent_reporters=..., agent_filter=lambda a: isinstance(a, Sheep))\r\n# Filter based on arbitrary condition, as in Epstein civil violence\r\n# An individual agent my change their \"type\" over time, and this filter supports that.\r\ndc_active = mesa.DataCollector(agent_reporters=..., agent_filter=lambda a: a.condition == \"Active\")\r\n```\r\n@tpike3 should have more concrete examples for multilevel Mesa with the Sugarscape model. You then export each of them to DF, and if one knows how the current Mesa data collector works, there is no further learning of the API behavior is needed. While it is very general, the downside is that you need several data collector objects for each group. But this downside too can be solved by implementing a convenient wrapper class/function.\r\n\r\nOn another note, I see https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/issues/348#issuecomment-1777533710 as an upgrade to #1701. The `self.agent_vars` object should probably be implemented in a separate+swappable+modular classes (`AgentDataSimple` for the current data collector, and `AgentDataByClass` for your proposal). The 2 solutions should have similar performance because both technically filter the agent from scratch every time the data collector happens.",

Currently, agent reporters get their agents hard-coded from model.scheduler.agents, assuming it exists and failing if your scheduler is named differently. One way to fix this would be to (optionally?) supply the scheduler to the DataCollector.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that if you have agents that are not part of any schedule you still can't collect data for them. That's already a problem right now, so it wouldn't worsen the situation, but maybe someone has a better long-term solution to this?\r\n\r\nAlso, if you use the same scheduler, there seems to be no way to collect data from _different_ agents. If you for example want to count the wealth of some of your agents, but not all agents have a wealth attribute, it fails. ",

Currently, agent reporters get their agents hard-coded from model.scheduler.agents, assuming it exists and failing if your scheduler is named differently. One way to fix this would be to (optionally?) supply the scheduler to the DataCollector.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that if you have agents that are not part of any schedule you still can't collect data for them. That's already a problem right now, so it wouldn't worsen the situation, but maybe someone has a better long-term solution to this?\r\n\r\nAlso, if you use the same scheduler, there seems to be no way to collect data from _different_ agents. If you for example want to count the wealth of some of your agents, but not all agents have a wealth attribute, it fails. ",

But this should not get in the way of finally establishing a solution for multi agent data collection. \n\nI will have to think a bit more about the proposal but I hope it will be well received by others as well.",

I would like some short version of the status and detected convergence value displayed to the user, so that they know explicitly when the model is running or has stopped, and so they have a bit of information about why it stopped. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI was thinking that a solara markdown output of a model property wouldn't be too hard to do, and on larger screens there may be space in the same row after the current step count - but I can't figure out an easy way to customize that `ModelController`. Another option could be an additional row after the controller row.\r\n\r\n",
