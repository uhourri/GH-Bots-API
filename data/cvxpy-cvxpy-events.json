Also added validations if `np.nan` occurs in lower and/or upper bound (I marked those situation as invalid and give back an error). I think the situation for `np.inf` in lower bound (and same logic `-np.inf` in upper) should be handled by now since if `np.inf` in lower and `np.inf` in upper, we get the Value error from the latest commit + if the user passes something else than `np.inf` in upper it must be considered smaller compared to `np.inf` (and the condition `upper_bounds >= lower_bounds` should trigger?)",

                "body": "I'm trying to minimize the function $(x^T \\Sigma x - 1)^2$ which is convex, where $x$ is a the optimization variable, a vector, and $\\Sigma$ is a covariance matrix. The expression $(x^T \\Sigma x)^2$ is DCP and can be optimized, but the expression $(x^T \\Sigma x - 1)^2$ is not DCP. I don't understand why this is, because $x^T \\Sigma x$ resolves down to a scalar, so essentially we have $(scalar - 1)^2=scaler$ which I believe is still convex.\r\n\r\nIf we expand the brackets in the expression $(x^T \\Sigma x - 1)^2$, let $u=x^T\\Sigma x$, then we have\r\n\r\n$$\r\n(x^T \\Sigma x - 1)^2 = (u - 1)^2 = (u - 1)(u - 1) = u^2 - 2u + 1\r\n$$\r\n\r\nAgain, the expression $u^2 - 2u + 1$ is not DCP, but the expression $u^2 + 2u + 1$ is DCP (note the sign change on the $2u$). Why is this the case and is there a way to resolve it? Thank you",
