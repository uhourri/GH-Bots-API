That means we\r\nhave to use the `seedToken` and `aliasToken` in place of less variables.\r\n- With this change, we also needed to use the default styling of\r\nant-design v4. For that, ant-design team provides a `compatible`\r\npackage.\r\n- The notification.`close` and `warn` have been renamed `destory` and\r\n`warning` respectively.\r\n- PR: https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/pull/1839/files is\r\nreversed in this PR, because we are not really on @types/react v18. We\r\nare locked on v16 due to yarn resolution. Having v18 written in\r\npackage.json was creating conflict with the installation of antd v5\r\n\r\n[screen-capture\r\n(5).webm](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/assets/94157520/550a79b7-b333-497b-9b73-70d0e6a1a748)\r\n\r\n## How was this change tested?\r\n- Manually, and unit tests\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] I have read\r\nhttps://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING_GUIDELINES.md\r\n- [x] I have signed all commits\r\n- [x] I have added unit tests for the new functionality\r\n- [x] I have run lint and test steps successfully\r\n  - for `jaeger`: `make lint test`\r\n  - for `jaeger-ui`: `yarn lint` and `yarn test`\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Ansh Goyal <anshgoyal1704@gmail.com>",

There may be some rules that are too painful to fix, so we may ignore them, but that should be done on a case by case basis, not as a blanket solution.\r\n\r\nAlso, a bit of advice if you're new to open source - **never send PRs that affect 70 files** (unless the changes are done by some automation). Pick a small scope, like a single module, and fix all errors there and submit a PR. Do another module in another PR.  Good read: https://github.com/PlaytikaOSS/small-pull-request-manifesto",

                "body": "### Requirement\r\n\r\nSince Jaeger is a distributed tracing platform, we sometimes need to look at the traces the whole day. Working with a high-contrast UI becomes a pain for the eye in such cases.\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nJaeger-UI currently supports only the light theme. A dark theme would help users focus on observability rather than eye strain.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\nSince react v18, and ant-design v5, the support for dynamic theming and state management has improved.\r\n\r\nant-design provides three theme algorithms: `defaultAlgorithm`, `darkAlgorithm`, and `compactAlgorithm`. Our concern is with the first two.\r\n\r\nWe can change the `jaegerTheme`'s default algorithm based on the current state of the theme. For example:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nconst jaegerTheme = {\r\n+ algorithm: theme.darkAlgorithm, <-- should be a state variable rather than hardcoded. Example: algorithm: currTheme\r\n  token: {\r\n    ...defaultTheme.token,\r\n    colorPrimary: '#199',\r\n  },\r\n  components: {\r\n    ...defaultTheme.components,\r\n    Layout: {\r\n      ...defaultTheme.components.Layout,\r\n      bodyBg: '#fff',\r\n      headerBg: '#404040',\r\n      footerBg: '#fff',\r\n      headerHeight: 48,\r\n      headerPadding: '0 50',\r\n....rest of code\r\n```\r\nwill change the whole Jaeger-UI to dark mode, but currently, since we haven't designed the whole UI that way, there are many areas where the theme still remains the same, i.e., light.\r\n\r\nState management features of react (ex, `useState` in react 18) can be used to manage the current algorithm's value and can be used to set the theme dynamically based on the click of a button, like in most applications.\r\n\r\nActionable items:\r\n- Introduce `enableThemes` config option (default: false) to allow to experiment with dark theme\r\n- Add a Switch kind of component to the NavBar to toggle between dark and light modes (guarded by `enableThemes`)\r\n- Remove the hard-coded themes from the codebase, and make use of colors based on the current theme state's algorithm\r\n- Go step-by-step, with small code changes/PRs at each step.\r\n- Use state management to change/store the current theme.\r\n\r\nRelevant documentation:\r\n- ant-design theme customization guide: https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme\r\n- https://ant.design/docs/spec/dark\r\n\r\n*Feel free to create child issues and relevant PRs related to this issue*",

                "body": "Yes. Most probably, we would have to create the two themes, light, and dark. Both have their own algorithms, and design tokens according to the style we want to apply to that specific component. The `useToken()` hook would allow us to consume the design tokens specified in the theme object.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```tsx\r\nconst darkTheme = {\r\n  algorithm: theme.darkAlgorithm,\r\n  token: {\r\n    ...defaultTheme.token,\r\n    colorPrimary: '#fff', // Primary color for dark mode\r\n  },\r\n...rest of the theme object\r\n```\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nconst lightTheme = {\r\n  algorithm: theme.defaultAlgorithm,\r\n  token: {\r\n    ...defaultTheme.token,\r\n    colorPrimary: '#000', // Primary color for light mode\r\n  },\r\n...rest of the theme object\r\n```\r\nWe can toggle between these two themes using the useState hook, or any other such thing. Now to consume the values defined over here, we can do it using the useToken hook like `useToken().colorPrimary` etc.\r\nThis useToken() hook can be consumed via the props received from `withRouteProps` HOC, or any other such approach because we are using class components and can't directly use hooks inside them.\r\n\r\nSo yes, that would be a lot of work to do, since we are trying to introduce dark mode support to a large codebase.",

For example, I understood as if we're expected to suppress the no-explicit-any errors that have been present since 2019-2020. Would it be okay if I fix as many errors as I can without suppressing and open a new PR? Or do I have to fix all errors?\r\n\r\nI can fix some ban-types errors and all no-unused-vars errors. For the others, I can try to do research and attempt to fix them without using suppress.\r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance for your answer.\r\n",
