The output is now present in each runtime in a separate file/source location, and checked for consistency in CI just as other Dafny-generated committed source is.\r\n* Also generalized how the runtime files are embedded in `DafnyPipeline` to support more than one file better (as Go already was).\r\n\r\nTODOs:\r\n\r\n* [x] Mechanism to check arities against the limit of 20 when --system-module is Omit\r\n* [x] Remove `internal` from C# helper code (and tests to confirm it works)\r\n* [x] Feature for pre-compiling built-ins (opt out for C++ and Rust for now)\r\n* [ ] Reference manual section on this topic (for feature to point to)\r\n\r\n### How has this been tested?\r\nMostly existing tests, but also added an internal version of `--include-runtime` for `dafny run`, so that `%testDafnyForEachCompiler` can include testing on C# when using the separate `DafnyRuntime.dll` library, as that behaves significantly different in this case.\r\n\r\n<small>By submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the [MIT license](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).</small>\r\n",

The output is now present in each runtime in a separate file/source location, and checked for consistency in CI just as other Dafny-generated committed source is.\r\n* Also generalized how the runtime files are embedded in `DafnyPipeline` to support more than one file better (as Go already was).\r\n\r\nTODOs:\r\n\r\n* [x] Mechanism to check arities against the limit of 20 when --system-module is Omit\r\n* [x] Remove `internal` from C# helper code (and tests to confirm it works)\r\n* [x] Feature for pre-compiling built-ins (opt out for C++ and Rust for now)\r\n* [ ] Reference manual section on this topic (for feature to point to)\r\n\r\n### How has this been tested?\r\nMostly existing tests, but also added an internal version of `--include-runtime` for `dafny run`, so that `%testDafnyForEachCompiler` can include testing on C# when using the separate `DafnyRuntime.dll` library, as that behaves significantly different in this case.\r\n\r\n<small>By submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the [MIT license](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).</small>\r\n",

The output is now present in each runtime in a separate file/source location, and checked for consistency in CI just as other Dafny-generated committed source is.\r\n* Also generalized how the runtime files are embedded in `DafnyPipeline` to support more than one file better (as Go already was).\r\n\r\nTODOs:\r\n\r\n* [x] Mechanism to check arities against the limit of 20 when --system-module is Omit\r\n* [x] Remove `internal` from C# helper code (and tests to confirm it works)\r\n* [x] Feature for pre-compiling built-ins (opt out for C++ and Rust for now)\r\n* [ ] Reference manual section on this topic (for feature to point to)\r\n\r\n### How has this been tested?\r\nMostly existing tests, but also added an internal version of `--include-runtime` for `dafny run`, so that `%testDafnyForEachCompiler` can include testing on C# when using the separate `DafnyRuntime.dll` library, as that behaves significantly different in this case.\r\n\r\n<small>By submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the [MIT license](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).</small>\r\n",

The output is now present in each runtime in a separate file/source location, and checked for consistency in CI just as other Dafny-generated committed source is.\r\n* Also generalized how the runtime files are embedded in `DafnyPipeline` to support more than one file better (as Go already was).\r\n\r\nTODOs:\r\n\r\n* [x] Mechanism to check arities against the limit of 20 when --system-module is Omit\r\n* [x] Remove `internal` from C# helper code (and tests to confirm it works)\r\n* [x] Feature for pre-compiling built-ins (opt out for C++ and Rust for now)\r\n* [ ] Reference manual section on this topic (for feature to point to)\r\n\r\n### How has this been tested?\r\nMostly existing tests, but also added an internal version of `--include-runtime` for `dafny run`, so that `%testDafnyForEachCompiler` can include testing on C# when using the separate `DafnyRuntime.dll` library, as that behaves significantly different in this case.\r\n\r\n<small>By submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the [MIT license](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).</small>\r\n",

There's a conflict between how refinement works and how replaceable modules work. \r\n\r\nReplaceable modules are implemented as a post-resolution feature. It swaps out references to the replaceable with the replacement. It has to work like this because `dafny verify` should work without the replacement being part of the source, so refinement can not rely on the replacement module being present.\r\n\r\nRefinement, as it is currently implemented, copies non-abstract parts of the refinee into the refiner during resolution, so you would need access to the replacement module during resolution, if you want to further refine it. \r\n\r\nWe could change refinement so it does use the replacement module _if_ its available, to influence refinement, but I consider that detrimental to maintainability so I think we should not do this. Refinement being implemented using copying is already problematic because it increases compilation time and generated code size. I think we should change refinement so it uses references to the refinee's members instead of copying them, and then we can also implement refinement of placeholders.\r\n\r\n### How has this been tested?\r\n- Add a happy flow test containing:\r\n  - A placeholder module that is replaced\r\n  - A placeholder module that refines an abstract module, and is replaced\r\n  - A placeholder module that replaces another placeholder module, and is replaced\r\n  - Various abstract imports using placeholders\r\n- Add complex tests that use different back-ends for a common library, showing off the main driver behind the feature.\r\n- Add a test that exposes all added errors\r\n  - A placeholder module can not be refined\r\n  - A placeholder module was not replaced\r\n  - A placeholder module was replaced more than once\r\n  - Cycle of replacement\r\n\r\n<small>By submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the [MIT license](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).</small>\r\n",

Here, it's now done in \"Pass 1\", which is alright. The one place we should avoid placing it, I think, is in the name resolution + type inference (\"Pass 0\"), because that pass is quite delicate.",

This not only helps declutter the name resolution phase, but it also makes `reads` processing apply to both (legacy and refresh) resolvers.\r\n* Fix various scoping issues of attribute resolution (e.g., include function result name in the scope).\r\n* Remove some old code in new resolver for things that are now being checked later in the resolution pipeline.\r\n* Make `{:warnShadowing}` be the same as `{:warnShadowing true}` (not `{:warnShadowing false}`)\r\n\r\nMinor changes:\r\n\r\n* fix: (new resolver) Resolve attributes of `:| assume`.\r\n* fix: Reuse `.MethodCallInfo` if called to compute it again\r\n* fix: Include method `reads` clauses in pretty print\r\n\r\n### How has this been tested?\r\n\r\nThe `dafny0/AttributeChecks.dfy` and `dafny0/Shadows.dfy` tests have been updated.\r\n\r\n<small>By submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the [MIT license](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).</small>\r\n",

This not only helps\r\ndeclutter the name resolution phase, but it also makes `reads`\r\nprocessing apply to both (legacy and refresh) resolvers.\r\n* Fix various scoping issues of attribute resolution (e.g., include\r\nfunction result name in the scope).\r\n* Remove some old code in new resolver for things that are now being\r\nchecked later in the resolution pipeline.\r\n* Make `{:warnShadowing}` be the same as `{:warnShadowing true}` (not\r\n`{:warnShadowing false}`)\r\n\r\nMinor changes:\r\n\r\n* fix: (new resolver) Resolve attributes of `:| assume`.\r\n* fix: Reuse `.MethodCallInfo` if called to compute it again\r\n* fix: Include method `reads` clauses in pretty print\r\n\r\n### How has this been tested?\r\n\r\nThe `dafny0/AttributeChecks.dfy` and `dafny0/Shadows.dfy` tests have\r\nbeen updated.\r\n\r\n<small>By submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution\r\nis made under the terms of the [MIT\r\nlicense](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).</small>"

This not only helps declutter the name resolution phase, but it also makes `reads` processing apply to both (legacy and refresh) resolvers.\r\n* Fix various scoping issues of attribute resolution (e.g., include function result name in the scope).\r\n* Remove some old code in new resolver for things that are now being checked later in the resolution pipeline.\r\n* Make `{:warnShadowing}` be the same as `{:warnShadowing true}` (not `{:warnShadowing false}`)\r\n\r\nMinor changes:\r\n\r\n* fix: (new resolver) Resolve attributes of `:| assume`.\r\n* fix: Reuse `.MethodCallInfo` if called to compute it again\r\n* fix: Include method `reads` clauses in pretty print\r\n\r\n### How has this been tested?\r\n\r\nThe `dafny0/AttributeChecks.dfy` and `dafny0/Shadows.dfy` tests have been updated.\r\n\r\n<small>By submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the [MIT license](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).</small>\r\n",

This not only helps\r\ndeclutter the name resolution phase, but it also makes `reads`\r\nprocessing apply to both (legacy and refresh) resolvers.\r\n* Fix various scoping issues of attribute resolution (e.g., include\r\nfunction result name in the scope).\r\n* Remove some old code in new resolver for things that are now being\r\nchecked later in the resolution pipeline.\r\n* Make `{:warnShadowing}` be the same as `{:warnShadowing true}` (not\r\n`{:warnShadowing false}`)\r\n\r\nMinor changes:\r\n\r\n* fix: (new resolver) Resolve attributes of `:| assume`.\r\n* fix: Reuse `.MethodCallInfo` if called to compute it again\r\n* fix: Include method `reads` clauses in pretty print\r\n\r\n### How has this been tested?\r\n\r\nThe `dafny0/AttributeChecks.dfy` and `dafny0/Shadows.dfy` tests have\r\nbeen updated.\r\n\r\n<small>By submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution\r\nis made under the terms of the [MIT\r\nlicense](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).</small>"

There's a conflict between how refinement works and how replaceable modules work. \r\n\r\nReplaceable modules are implemented as a post-resolution feature. It swaps out references to the replaceable with the replacement. It has to work like this because `dafny verify` should work without the replacement being part of the source, so refinement can not rely on the replacement module being present.\r\n\r\nRefinement, as it is currently implemented, copies non-abstract parts of the refinee into the refiner during resolution, so you would need access to the replacement module during resolution, if you want to further refine it. \r\n\r\nWe could change refinement so it does use the replacement module _if_ its available, to influence refinement, but I consider that detrimental to maintainability so I think we should not do this. Refinement being implemented using copying is already problematic because it increases compilation time and generated code size. I think we should change refinement so it uses references to the refinee's members instead of copying them, and then we can also implement refinement of placeholders.\r\n\r\n### How has this been tested?\r\n- Add a happy flow test containing:\r\n  - A placeholder module that is replaced\r\n  - A placeholder module that refines an abstract module, and is replaced\r\n  - A placeholder module that replaces another placeholder module, and is replaced\r\n  - Various abstract imports using placeholders\r\n- Add complex tests that use different back-ends for a common library, showing off the main driver behind the feature.\r\n- Add a test that exposes all added errors\r\n  - A placeholder module can not be refined\r\n  - A placeholder module was not replaced\r\n  - A placeholder module was replaced more than once\r\n  - Cycle of replacement\r\n\r\n<small>By submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the [MIT license](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).</small>\r\n",

                "body": "> The problem I have with this approach is that it's no longer possible to replace the standard library shipped with a version of Dafny with another standard library (i.e. an updated version)\r\n\r\nI'm not too concerned with that since for now the standard libraries are tightly coupled to the Dafny distribution, and in some cases we'll take advantage of that to provide libraries like `Interop` that may need to change with each Dafny version.\r\n\r\n> This is a strong hint for me that a better way to ship the standard library for Dafny is to ship the files, stored in plain in Dafny.exe and regurgitated on demand, and not include them or precompile them in the Dafny Runtime.\r\n\r\nI do think it would be unfortunate to provide standard libraries but force users that need a single compiled version of them to build and distribute it themselves. We could consider distributing the compiled standard libraries as a separate package in each language instead of adding them to the runtimes, but that seems like more overhead for both us and customers without a lot of benefit right now.\r\n",

Then that user can no longer create an application that uses the previous two applications.\r\nHowever, if that user delays the compilation and only perform compilation after including all the Dafny libraries and target-specific backend file, then no duplication exists.\r\nThis is a strong hint for me that a better way to ship the standard library for Dafny is to ship the files, stored in plain in Dafny.exe and regurgitated on demand, and not include them or precompile them in the Dafny Runtime.",

There's a conflict between how refinement works and how replaceable modules work. \r\n\r\nReplaceable modules are implemented as a post-resolution feature. It swaps out references to the replaceable with the replacement. It has to work like this because `dafny verify` should work without the replacement being part of the source, so refinement can not rely on the replacement module being present.\r\n\r\nRefinement, as it is currently implemented, copies non-abstract parts of the refinee into the refiner during resolution, so you would need access to the replacement module during resolution, if you want to further refine it. \r\n\r\nWe could change refinement so it does use the replacement module _if_ its available, to influence refinement, but I consider that detrimental to maintainability so I think we should not do this. Refinement being implemented using copying is already problematic because it increases compilation time and generated code size. I think we should change refinement so it uses references to the refinee's members instead of copying them, and then we can also implement refinement of placeholders.\r\n\r\n### How has this been tested?\r\n- Add a happy flow test containing:\r\n  - A placeholder module that is replaced\r\n  - A placeholder module that refines an abstract module, and is replaced\r\n  - A placeholder module that replaces another placeholder module, and is replaced\r\n  - Various abstract imports using placeholders\r\n- Add complex tests that use different back-ends for a common library, showing off the main driver behind the feature.\r\n- Add a test that exposes all added errors\r\n  - A placeholder module can not be refined\r\n  - A placeholder module was not replaced\r\n  - A placeholder module was replaced more than once\r\n  - Cycle of replacement\r\n\r\n<small>By submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the [MIT license](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).</small>\r\n",

There's a conflict between how refinement works and how replaceable modules work. \r\n\r\nReplaceable modules are implemented as a post-resolution feature. It swaps out references to the replaceable with the replacement. It has to work like this because `dafny verify` should work without the replacement being part of the source, so refinement can not rely on the replacement module being present.\r\n\r\nRefinement, as it is currently implemented, copies non-abstract parts of the refinee into the refiner during resolution, so you would need access to the replacement module during resolution, if you want to further refine it. \r\n\r\nWe could change refinement so it does use the replacement module _if_ its available, to influence refinement, but I consider that detrimental to maintainability so I think we should not do this. Refinement being implemented using copying is already problematic because it increases compilation time and generated code size. I think we should change refinement so it uses references to the refinee's members instead of copying them, and then we can also implement refinement of placeholders.\r\n\r\n### How has this been tested?\r\n- Add a happy flow test containing:\r\n  - A placeholder module that is replaced\r\n  - A placeholder module that refines an abstract module, and is replaced\r\n  - A placeholder module that replaces another placeholder module, and is replaced\r\n  - Various abstract imports using placeholders\r\n- Add complex tests that use different back-ends for a common library, showing off the main driver behind the feature.\r\n- Add a test that exposes all added errors\r\n  - A placeholder module can not be refined\r\n  - A placeholder module was not replaced\r\n  - A placeholder module was replaced more than once\r\n  - Cycle of replacement\r\n\r\n<small>By submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the [MIT license](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).</small>\r\n",

                "body": "> Correct me if I'm wrong @robin-aws , but when we will include the standard library in Dafny itself, we will include files, based on what the user imports, not based on the compiler's mode. So ideally, our standard library has late bindings for all supported languages and the compiler will just pick the one that is the most relevant to the compilation mode, or say something like \"language blah does not have a replacing module for X defined in Y. Please define one yourself.\"\r\n\r\nMy plan is that the `DafnyStandardLibraries.doo` file that `--standard-libraries` implicitly adds for verification will just have the abstract/replacable `FileIO` module in it, let's say in a `FileIO.dfy` file. There will be other Dafny files defining the concrete module implementation for each target, `FileIOForJava.dfy` for example. And for completeness let's say there's a supporting Java file like `FileIO.java`. All three files will be compiled into the Java runtime: the Java files output from compiling `FileIO.dfy` and `FileIOForJava.dfy`, and `FileIO.java`. That means there will be a Makefile command something like this to run before building `DafnyRuntime.jar`:\r\n\r\n```make\r\ndafny translate java FileIO.dfy FileIOForJava.dfy ... --output DafnyStandardLibraries\r\ncp -r DafnyStandardLibraries-java DafnyRuntimeJava/src/main/dafny-generated\r\n```\r\n\r\nI didn't set this up in the initial PR to add stdlib support because #511 means you hit duplicate definitions when you try to add Dafny-generated code to the runtimes, much worse than existing contexts, so I'm fixing that first. https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/4658 already adds some similar make targets to pre-compile the `_System` module into the runtimes, though.\r\n\r\nHaving project file features for collecting the right input files into `dafny translate` would certainly be nice, but in the actual Makefile it's not too hard to collect them with globs. \r\n\r\nI think you're right that this can work without `replaceable` modules, by having consumers refer to an undefined `FileIO` module that is filed in at compile time by one of the target-specific versions. I can say from doing [something similar for the `UnicodeStrings` module](https://github.com/dafny-lang/libraries/blob/master/src/Unicode/UnicodeStrings.dfy) that it's a real pain when writing the code, because you have unresolved references the IDE can't deal with, so you're stuck with verifying using the CLI.",

There's a conflict between how refinement works and how replaceable modules work. \r\n\r\nReplaceable modules are implemented as a post-resolution feature. It swaps out references to the replaceable with the replacement. It has to work like this because `dafny verify` should work without the replacement being part of the source, so refinement can not rely on the replacement module being present.\r\n\r\nRefinement, as it is currently implemented, copies non-abstract parts of the refinee into the refiner during resolution, so you would need access to the replacement module during resolution, if you want to further refine it. \r\n\r\nWe could change refinement so it does use the replacement module _if_ its available, to influence refinement, but I consider that detrimental to maintainability so I think we should not do this. Refinement being implemented using copying is already problematic because it increases compilation time and generated code size. I think we should change refinement so it uses references to the refinee's members instead of copying them, and then we can also implement refinement of placeholders.\r\n\r\n### How has this been tested?\r\n- Add a happy flow test containing:\r\n  - A placeholder module that is replaced\r\n  - A placeholder module that refines an abstract module, and is replaced\r\n  - A placeholder module that replaces another placeholder module, and is replaced\r\n  - Various abstract imports using placeholders\r\n- Add complex tests that use different back-ends for a common library, showing off the main driver behind the feature.\r\n- Add a test that exposes all added errors\r\n  - A placeholder module can not be refined\r\n  - A placeholder module was not replaced\r\n  - A placeholder module was replaced more than once\r\n  - Cycle of replacement\r\n\r\n<small>By submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the [MIT license](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).</small>\r\n",
