                "body": "Feature Request\r\nWhile writing component tests for  components in a microfrontend architecture, there can be cases in which there is a requirement to mock methods that are imported in the component which is being tested. Few example of this use case can be as follows:\r\n\r\n- The component being tested gets the data from indexed db through wrapper methods which are imported in the component.  Instead of initializing and populating the indexed db for each component test, it will be much easier if we are able to mock the imported method in the component to get the desired data.\r\n<img width=\"911\" alt=\"Playwright mock\" src=\"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/89134825/cc462ed2-8f2b-402f-a5df-615be2231485\">\r\n\r\n-  There can be a service which is used across microfrontends that returns data asynchronously. Internally it may or may not make a network request depending on the data being requested. In this scenario, it will be helpful if we are able to mock the imported methods of the service in the component being tested.\r\nDo you think others might benefit from this as well? Yes\r\n",

How does the Playwright team prioritize issues?\r\n2. Is there a public roadmap that can be consulted? Currently, it is only possible to see through the tags which issues will be involved in the next two releases (1.39 and 1.40).\r\n3. I wrote these questions previously in [Discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/discussions/27378), but it went unnoticed. Perhaps it is better to completely deprecate the \"Discussions\" section considering that it is little used and only use \"Issues\" and the discord channel. Reducing communication channels will make communication more effective, what do you think?",
