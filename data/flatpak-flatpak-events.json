Both the\r\n  public and private instance directories share the same parent\r\n  directory.\r\n  \r\n  The private instance directory relies on the same lock file as the\r\n  public instance directory, and both are garbage-collected together.\r\n\r\n* run: Save flatpak-run environment\r\n\r\n  Save the environment in which flatpak-run was executed in the private\r\n  instance directory.\r\n \r\n  The environment is saved in \"env -0\" format.\r\n\r\n* utils: Add flatpak_parse_env_block()\r\n\r\n  This function can be used to parse environment variable blocks in\r\n  \"env -0\" format from a buffer. It performs a few format checks during\r\n  its parsing and returns an error if an issue is found.\r\n  \r\n  When successful, it returns a string array containing each individual\r\n  environment variable parsed from the buffer, in the same format as\r\n  the return value of g_get_environ().\r\n  \r\n  The implementation of this function is based on\r\n  flatpak_context_parse_env_block().\r\n\r\n* context: Use flatpak_parse_env_block()\r\n    \r\n  No change in behavior, except minor wording of the error message.\r\n\r\n* instance: Add flatpak_instance_get_run_environ()\r\n\r\n  This private function returns the environment in which flatpak-run\r\n  was executed for a given FlatpakInstance.\r\n\r\n* portal: Inherit flatpak-run environment from parent when spawning\r\n\r\n  Instead of inheriting the portal's environment when spawning a\r\n  subsandbox using flatpak-run, inherit the environment in which\r\n  flatpak-run was originally executed for the parent instance.\r\n  \r\n  This means that environment variables that affect the sandbox setup\r\n  of the parent instance now also propagate to the setup of\r\n  subsandboxes, including \"FLATPAK_GL_DRIVERS\".\r\n  \r\n  Closes: https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/5278",

Both the\r\n  public and private instance directories share the same parent\r\n  directory.\r\n  \r\n  The private instance directory relies on the same lock file as the\r\n  public instance directory, and both are garbage-collected together.\r\n\r\n* run: Save flatpak-run environment\r\n\r\n  Save the environment in which flatpak-run was executed in the private\r\n  instance directory.\r\n \r\n  The environment is saved in \"env -0\" format.\r\n\r\n* utils: Add flatpak_parse_env_block()\r\n\r\n  This function can be used to parse environment variable blocks in\r\n  \"env -0\" format from a buffer. It performs a few format checks during\r\n  its parsing and returns an error if an issue is found.\r\n  \r\n  When successful, it returns a string array containing each individual\r\n  environment variable parsed from the buffer, in the same format as\r\n  the return value of g_get_environ().\r\n  \r\n  The implementation of this function is based on\r\n  flatpak_context_parse_env_block().\r\n\r\n* context: Use flatpak_parse_env_block()\r\n    \r\n  No change in behavior, except minor wording of the error message.\r\n\r\n* instance: Add flatpak_instance_get_run_environ()\r\n\r\n  This private function returns the environment in which flatpak-run\r\n  was executed for a given FlatpakInstance.\r\n\r\n* portal: Inherit flatpak-run environment from parent when spawning\r\n\r\n  Instead of inheriting the portal's environment when spawning a\r\n  subsandbox using flatpak-run, inherit the environment in which\r\n  flatpak-run was originally executed for the parent instance.\r\n  \r\n  This means that environment variables that affect the sandbox setup\r\n  of the parent instance now also propagate to the setup of\r\n  subsandboxes, including \"FLATPAK_GL_DRIVERS\".\r\n  \r\n  Closes: https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/5278",

Unfortunately, the error is obscure (\"volume doesn\u2019t implement mount\" in gio mount), so not trivial to identify.\r\nI think that if GIO_USE_VFS should be 'local' for flatpak to work, it should not be passed to the processes it runs from packages. \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nthe variable should not be passed\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nIt is\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",
