                "body": "So ever since the New World Call of the Wilds DLC update i've been having some nasty consistent crashes at around the 1 hour mark. The most noticeable crash is the game picture stops updating and then i get disconnected from the game, however the game does not crash even after waiting 10min.\r\nI've tried to look at the Proton Logs but i cant find anything among the millions of lines...\r\nI did however grep for `err:`, `warn:` and `info:` lines and found these DXVK errors at the bottom of the log\r\nIt always starts with\r\n```\r\nD3D11: Cannot create texture\r\n```\r\nThen these\r\n```\r\nDxvkBufferView: Failed to create buffer view\r\n```\r\nToday i got a different error message but in the same ball park\r\n```\r\nDxvkImageView: Failed to create image view\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo i wonder, is this a error message for the DXVK devs or the game devs that a texture is broken?\r\n\r\nThis is what i've tried:\r\n- I've tested both x11 and Wayland\r\n- I've tested both KDE and Gnome\r\n- I've tested Proton Experimental, GE-Proton 8-20 and Proton 8.0-4\r\n- I've tested DX11 and DX12\r\n- I've tested a bunch of launch options\r\n- I've reset the ShaderCache in steamapps/shadercache/1063730/DXVK_state_cache/\r\n- I've checked that i'm not running out of VRAM\r\n- I've deleted `SteamLibrary/steamapps/compatdata/1063730/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/*/AGS` as someone suggested for crashes\r\n- I've \"Deleted all data and applications inside this wineprefix\" via ProtonTricks\r\n- I've installed d3dcompiler_43 via ProtonTricks\r\n- I've installed d3dcompiler_47 via ProtonTricks (Fixes fixme:d3dcompiler:skip_u32_unknown in the logs)\r\n- I've installed dxvk via ProtonTricks\r\n- I've reinstalled New World from scratch\r\n- I've removed Mangohud and Gamemode from launch options\r\n- PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 makes it \"The computer fails to meet one or more of the minimum specifications in order to run\" because its 1280 MB VRAM by default. Workaround to set VideoMemorySize to 11GB in Registry, however the rendering is messed up and not worth it.\r\n- I've tested vkd3d-proton via Protontricks\r\n- I've tested nvidia-open\r\n\r\nThe ONE thing that DID work is to play differently in one old area, the log file was calm and i did not crash for 2.5 hours. Which probably indicates a issue with a texture?\r\n\r\n### Software information\r\nNew World on any settings.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Click for System information</summary>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n- Operating System: Arch Linux \r\n- KDE Plasma Version: 5.27.9\r\n- KDE Frameworks Version: 5.111.0\r\n- Qt Version: 5.15.11\r\n- Kernel Version: 6.5.8-arch1-1 (64-bit)\r\n- Graphics Platform: X11\r\n- Processors: 32 \u00d7 AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor\r\n- Memory: 31.3 GiB of RAM\r\n- Graphics Processor: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti/PCIe/SSE2\r\n- Manufacturer: ASUS\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n- GPU: Nvidia 3080 ti\r\n- Driver: Proprietary and Open-Source kernel 535.113.01\r\n- Wine version: Proton 7.0-6, 8.0-4 and GE-Proton 8-20\r\n- DXVK version: No clue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Apitrace file(s)\r\n- Put a link here\r\n\r\nFor instructions on how to use apitrace, see: https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/wiki/Using-Apitrace\r\n\r\n### Log files\r\nThe logs are TOO DAMN BIG (50mill lines and 5GB in 1 hour.\r\nMost of the log is flodded with these\r\n```\r\n9644.436:0134:0374:trace:unwind:dump_unwind_info     0xa: pushq %rdi\r\n```\r\n[steam-1063730-err.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/13182654/steam-1063730-err.log)\r\n[steam-1063730-info.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/13182655/steam-1063730-info.log)\r\n[steam-1063730-err2.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/13182669/steam-1063730-err2.log)\r\n\r\nI currently have a 1.2GiB crash log file i can grep if anyone have something i can search for",

                "body": "So ever since the New World Call of the Wilds DLC update i've been having some nasty consistent crashes at around the 1 hour mark. The most noticeable crash is the game picture stops updating and then i get disconnected from the game, however the game does not crash even after waiting 10min.\r\nI've tried to look at the Proton Logs but i cant find anything among the millions of lines...\r\nI did however grep for `err:`, `warn:` and `info:` lines and found these DXVK errors at the bottom of the log\r\nIt always starts with\r\n```\r\nD3D11: Cannot create texture\r\n```\r\nThen these\r\n```\r\nDxvkBufferView: Failed to create buffer view\r\n```\r\nToday i got a different error message but in the same ball park\r\n```\r\nDxvkImageView: Failed to create image view\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo i wonder, is this a error message for the DXVK devs or the game devs that a texture is broken?\r\n\r\nThis is what i've tried:\r\n- I've tested both x11 and Wayland\r\n- I've tested both KDE and Gnome\r\n- I've tested Proton Experimental, GE-Proton 8-20 and Proton 8.0-4\r\n- I've tested DX11 and DX12\r\n- I've tested a bunch of launch options\r\n- I've reset the ShaderCache in steamapps/shadercache/1063730/DXVK_state_cache/\r\n- I've checked that i'm not running out of VRAM\r\n- I've deleted `SteamLibrary/steamapps/compatdata/1063730/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/*/AGS` as someone suggested for crashes\r\n- I've \"Deleted all data and applications inside this wineprefix\" via ProtonTricks\r\n- I've installed d3dcompiler_43 via ProtonTricks\r\n- I've installed d3dcompiler_47 via ProtonTricks (Fixes fixme:d3dcompiler:skip_u32_unknown in the logs)\r\n- I've installed dxvk via ProtonTricks\r\n- I've reinstalled New World from scratch\r\n- I've removed Mangohud and Gamemode from launch options\r\n- PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 makes it \"The computer fails to meet one or more of the minimum specifications in order to run\" because its 1280 MB VRAM by default. Workaround to set VideoMemorySize to 11GB in Registry, however the rendering is messed up and not worth it.\r\n- I've tested vkd3d-proton via Protontricks\r\n- I've tested nvidia-open\r\n\r\nThe ONE thing that DID work is to play differently in one old area, the log file was calm and i did not crash for 2.5 hours. Which probably indicates a issue with a texture?\r\n\r\n### Software information\r\nNew World on any settings.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Click for System information</summary>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n- Operating System: Arch Linux \r\n- KDE Plasma Version: 5.27.9\r\n- KDE Frameworks Version: 5.111.0\r\n- Qt Version: 5.15.11\r\n- Kernel Version: 6.5.8-arch1-1 (64-bit)\r\n- Graphics Platform: X11\r\n- Processors: 32 \u00d7 AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor\r\n- Memory: 31.3 GiB of RAM\r\n- Graphics Processor: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti/PCIe/SSE2\r\n- Manufacturer: ASUS\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n- GPU: Nvidia 3080 ti\r\n- Driver: Proprietary and Open-Source kernel 535.113.01\r\n- Wine version: Proton 7.0-6, 8.0-4 and GE-Proton 8-20\r\n- DXVK version: No clue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Apitrace file(s)\r\n- Put a link here\r\n\r\nFor instructions on how to use apitrace, see: https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/wiki/Using-Apitrace\r\n\r\n### Log files\r\nThe logs are TOO DAMN BIG (50mill lines and 5GB in 1 hour.\r\nMost of the log is flodded with these\r\n```\r\n9644.436:0134:0374:trace:unwind:dump_unwind_info     0xa: pushq %rdi\r\n```\r\n[steam-1063730-err.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/13182654/steam-1063730-err.log)\r\n[steam-1063730-info.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/13182655/steam-1063730-info.log)\r\n[steam-1063730-err2.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/13182669/steam-1063730-err2.log)\r\n\r\nI currently have a 1.2GiB crash log file i can grep if anyone have something i can search for",

It doesnt fix it at all.\r\nSo i used the CRU , Changed the 1080p(thats what im using ingame too) resolution refreshrate to 50 then the actual monitor frequency from properties \r\n![image](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/assets/131720816/886cf521-8676-4fef-8ddc-5ff4e3704e23)\r\nChecked the games res (it was on 59hz) changed to 50hz and i tried vsync on and off.\r\nNo change\r\nWhat is weird to me is no one can discern even where the problem is from one (significant?) clue. The shaking is NOT the same in all view directions. Looking down has alot less. ",

Cause this is a bug from Ubisoft's \"bugged\" testing on 50hz.\r\n\r\nCpu: i7 6700k. I had this same problem on my previous intel g4560\r\nMonitor is 60hz but i had locked max fps on 58 fps(dont ask why) . \r\nYesterday i tried to retest if its the nvidia controlpanel settings Vsync-wise , but the same problem remains. yes i even changed the max fps to 60 to eliminate variables.\r\nNow i rechecked vsync off or on, no change.Both from nvidia control panel (global settings) and from within the game.\r\n\r\nNever used a controler,always keyboard and mouse",

Workaround to set VideoMemorySize to 11GB in Registry, however the rendering is messed up and not worth it.\r\n- I've tested vkd3d-proton via Protontricks\r\n- I've tested nvidia-open\r\n\r\nThe ONE thing that DID work is to play differently in one old area, the log file was calm and i did not crash for 2.5 hours. Which probably indicates a issue with a texture?\r\n\r\n### Software information\r\nNew World on any settings.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Click for System information</summary>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n- Operating System: Arch Linux \r\n- KDE Plasma Version: 5.27.9\r\n- KDE Frameworks Version: 5.111.0\r\n- Qt Version: 5.15.11\r\n- Kernel Version: 6.5.8-arch1-1 (64-bit)\r\n- Graphics Platform: X11\r\n- Processors: 32 \u00d7 AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor\r\n- Memory: 31.3 GiB of RAM\r\n- Graphics Processor: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti/PCIe/SSE2\r\n- Manufacturer: ASUS\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n- GPU: Nvidia 3080 ti\r\n- Driver: Proprietary and Open-Source kernel 535.113.01\r\n- Wine version: Proton 7.0-6, 8.0-4 and GE-Proton 8-20\r\n- DXVK version: No clue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Apitrace file(s)\r\n- Put a link here\r\n\r\nFor instructions on how to use apitrace, see: https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/wiki/Using-Apitrace\r\n\r\n### Log files\r\nThe logs are TOO DAMN BIG (50mill lines and 5GB in 1 hour.\r\nMost of the log is flodded with these\r\n```\r\n9644.436:0134:0374:trace:unwind:dump_unwind_info     0xa: pushq %rdi\r\n```\r\n[steam-1063730-err.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/13182654/steam-1063730-err.log)\r\n[steam-1063730-info.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/13182655/steam-1063730-info.log)\r\n[steam-1063730-err2.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/13182669/steam-1063730-err2.log)\r\n\r\nI currently have a 1.2GiB crash log file i can grep if anyone have something i can search for",

                "body": "After playing the game with the x32 version of dxvk after a minute or so, the game freezes and forces me to restart my pc. The game also sometimes crashes when i load the game (seems to be fixed by running the game through the .exe file instead of steam). When i replace dxvk x32 with the x64 version, the overall performance seems to be better, stutters are gone, still get minor frame drops (from 70 fps to 50), but after a while the game gets enormous frame drops (<1 fps) and im forced to quit the game. The dxvk patch works perfectly on my brothers pc even though its specs are worse than mine. (has an nvidia gpu, think i heard that amd gpus have bad performance on older games?)\r\nTried [qinlili23333]'s sr2 patch that is supposed to fix the games memory management. The game runs nearly perfectly (stable 50 fps, odd stutter here and there), but i get a constant flickering bar at the bottom of my screen. (Fixed by enabling fullscreen vsync). Combining the .exe patch and dxvk makes the game run worse than vanilla.\r\nSo, as of now qinlili's patch without dxvk runs the best for me, but i hope that someday dxvk will work for me and i would be able to run the game perfectly at a stable 60 fps. Btw the game's api is x32, so it seems strange to me that the x64 patch of dxvk runs better than the x32 for me. I will attach the games log files from every different version/patch i tested. Hope this post helps development or helps someone else get better performance in-game. Next, i will test DXVK-Async's and DxWrapper's effect on the performance. Will update if i find something worthwhile.\r\n[dxvk32nopatch.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/11301207/dxvk32nopatch.log)\r\n[dxvkx64nopatch.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/11301208/dxvkx64nopatch.log)\r\n[x32crashonloadgame.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/11301209/x32crashonloadgame.log)\r\n[nodxvk_patchedexe.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/11301210/nodxvk_patchedexe.log)\r\n",

                "body": "After playing the game with the x32 version of dxvk after a minute or so, the game freezes and forces me to restart my pc. The game also sometimes crashes when i load the game (seems to be fixed by running the game through the .exe file instead of steam). When i replace dxvk x32 with the x64 version, the overall performance seems to be better, stutters are gone, still get minor frame drops (from 70 fps to 50), but after a while the game gets enormous frame drops (<1 fps) and im forced to quit the game. The dxvk patch works perfectly on my brothers pc even though its specs are worse than mine. (has an nvidia gpu, think i heard that amd gpus have bad performance on older games?)\r\nTried [qinlili23333]'s sr2 patch that is supposed to fix the games memory management. The game runs nearly perfectly (stable 50 fps, odd stutter here and there), but i get a constant flickering bar at the bottom of my screen. (Fixed by enabling fullscreen vsync). Combining the .exe patch and dxvk makes the game run worse than vanilla.\r\nSo, as of now qinlili's patch without dxvk runs the best for me, but i hope that someday dxvk will work for me and i would be able to run the game perfectly at a stable 60 fps. Btw the game's api is x32, so it seems strange to me that the x64 patch of dxvk runs better than the x32 for me. I will attach the games log files from every different version/patch i tested. Hope this post helps development or helps someone else get better performance in-game. Next, i will test DXVK-Async's and DxWrapper's effect on the performance. Will update if i find something worthwhile.\r\n[dxvk32nopatch.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/11301207/dxvk32nopatch.log)\r\n[dxvkx64nopatch.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/11301208/dxvkx64nopatch.log)\r\n[x32crashonloadgame.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/11301209/x32crashonloadgame.log)\r\n[nodxvk_patchedexe.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/11301210/nodxvk_patchedexe.log)\r\n",

                "body": "After playing the game with the x32 version of dxvk after a minute or so, the game freezes and forces me to restart my pc. The game also sometimes crashes when i load the game (seems to be fixed by running the game through the .exe file instead of steam). When i replace dxvk x32 with the x64 version, the overall performance seems to be better, stutters are gone, still get minor frame drops (from 70 fps to 50), but after a while the game gets enormous frame drops (<1 fps) and im forced to quit the game. The dxvk patch works perfectly on my brothers pc even though its specs are worse than mine. (has an nvidia gpu, think i heard that amd gpus have bad performance on older games?)\r\nTried [qinlili23333]'s sr2 patch that is supposed to fix the games memory management. The game runs nearly perfectly (stable 50 fps, odd stutter here and there), but i get a constant flickering bar at the bottom of my screen. (Fixed by enabling fullscreen vsync). Combining the .exe patch and dxvk makes the game run worse than vanilla.\r\nSo, as of now qinlili's patch without dxvk runs the best for me, but i hope that someday dxvk will work for me and i would be able to run the game perfectly at a stable 60 fps. Btw the game's api is x32, so it seems strange to me that the x64 patch of dxvk runs better than the x32 for me. I will attach the games log files from every different version/patch i tested. Hope this post helps development or helps someone else get better performance in-game. Next, i will test DXVK-Async's and DxWrapper's effect on the performance. Will update if i find something worthwhile.\r\n[dxvk32nopatch.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/11301207/dxvk32nopatch.log)\r\n[dxvkx64nopatch.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/11301208/dxvkx64nopatch.log)\r\n[x32crashonloadgame.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/11301209/x32crashonloadgame.log)\r\n[nodxvk_patchedexe.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/11301210/nodxvk_patchedexe.log)\r\n",

                "body": "After playing the game with the x32 version of dxvk after a minute or so, the game freezes and forces me to restart my pc. The game also sometimes crashes when i load the game (seems to be fixed by running the game through the .exe file instead of steam). When i replace dxvk x32 with the x64 version, the overall performance seems to be better, stutters are gone, still get minor frame drops (from 70 fps to 50), but after a while the game gets enormous frame drops (<1 fps) and im forced to quit the game. The dxvk patch works perfectly on my brothers pc even though its specs are worse than mine. (has an nvidia gpu, think i heard that amd gpus have bad performance on older games?)\r\nTried [qinlili23333]'s sr2 patch that is supposed to fix the games memory management. The game runs nearly perfectly (stable 50 fps, odd stutter here and there), but i get a constant flickering bar at the bottom of my screen. (Fixed by enabling fullscreen vsync). Combining the .exe patch and dxvk makes the game run worse than vanilla.\r\nSo, as of now qinlili's patch without dxvk runs the best for me, but i hope that someday dxvk will work for me and i would be able to run the game perfectly at a stable 60 fps. Btw the game's api is x32, so it seems strange to me that the x64 patch of dxvk runs better than the x32 for me. I will attach the games log files from every different version/patch i tested. Hope this post helps development or helps someone else get better performance in-game. Next, i will test DXVK-Async's and DxWrapper's effect on the performance. Will update if i find something worthwhile.\r\n[dxvk32nopatch.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/11301207/dxvk32nopatch.log)\r\n[dxvkx64nopatch.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/11301208/dxvkx64nopatch.log)\r\n[x32crashonloadgame.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/11301209/x32crashonloadgame.log)\r\n[nodxvk_patchedexe.log](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/files/11301210/nodxvk_patchedexe.log)\r\n",
