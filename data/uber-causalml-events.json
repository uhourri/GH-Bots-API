This saves some allocations.\r\n\r\n- in finding the best split, we use mostly scalar values\r\n  (e.g. best_col and best_value in favor of one single tuple\r\n  bestAttribute) to keep the current best, and further avoids\r\n  allocating many objects. After finding the best split, we use the\r\n  original divideSet to get the X_l and X_r and subsequently\r\n  best_set_left and best_set_right which are used in subsequent\r\n  construction of subtrees of the left and right branches; and\r\n  calculate bestAttribute as a tuple.\r\n\r\n- also, from the annotation of Cython, it seems some constant values\r\n  such as the list of percentile values to test for threshold will be\r\n  constructed in each iteration of the loop, because the Cython\r\n  compiler cannot be sure that the list will not be modified by\r\n  np.percentile, but since we can be sure, we create the list once\r\n  outside the loop.\r\n\r\nModification verison 2, on 2023-10-05 by Peter Lo <peterloleungyau@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n- modified group_uniqueCounts to group_uniqueCounts_to_arr, to use\r\n  pre-allocated flat numpy array to fill in the counts, instead of\r\n  using list of list.\r\n\r\n- modified tree_node_summary to tree_node_summary_to_arr to use\r\n  pre-allocated flat numpy arrays, and to fill in the node summary in\r\n  new format, which consist of two parallel arrays: out_summary_p for\r\n  [P(Y=1|T=i)...] and out_summary_n for [N(T=i)...], instead of the\r\n  previous list of list.\r\n\r\n- for all the evaluation functions, created the arr_evaluate_*\r\n  versions that uses the new node summary format. Also created\r\n  arr_normI as the counter-part of normI using the new node summary\r\n  format.\r\n\r\n- added some cdef to give type declarations to help speed up some\r\n  calculations.\r\n\r\nModifcation version 3, on 2023-10-06 by Peter Lo <peterloleungyau@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n- combine divideSet_len and group_uniqueCounts_to_arr to be\r\n  group_counts_by_divide, so as to reduce creating intermediate\r\n  objects. This calculates the group counts for the left branch.\r\n\r\n- created tree_node_summary_from_counts from tree_node_summary_to_arr,\r\n  to use pre-calculated group counts (e.g. by group_counts_by_divide).\r\n\r\n- for right branch, calculate the group counts by subtracting the\r\n  group counts of left branch from the total count (pre-calculated\r\n  outside the looping of choosing split points), which should be more\r\n  efficient than looping through the data again.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to **CausalML**?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

                "body": "Mainly reduce allocation, in a synthetic data of 40000 rows, about 400 features, 4 treatments, there is a speed up of about 65x over the original version.\r\n\r\nThe main modifications are in the comments, reproduced below for convenience.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nModified to speed up UpliftTreeClassifier.growDecisionTreeFrom and\r\nconsequently can also speed up UpliftTreeClassifier.fit, and\r\nUpliftRandomForestClassifier.\r\n\r\nModification version 1, on 2023-10-04 by Peter Lo <peterloleungyau@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n- created divideSet_len from divideSet, which does not split the whole\r\n  X into X_l and X_r, but returns len(X_l) and len(X_r) instead,\r\n  because in finding the best split, the whole X_l and X_r are not\r\n  used. This saves some allocations.\r\n\r\n- in finding the best split, we use mostly scalar values\r\n  (e.g. best_col and best_value in favor of one single tuple\r\n  bestAttribute) to keep the current best, and further avoids\r\n  allocating many objects. After finding the best split, we use the\r\n  original divideSet to get the X_l and X_r and subsequently\r\n  best_set_left and best_set_right which are used in subsequent\r\n  construction of subtrees of the left and right branches; and\r\n  calculate bestAttribute as a tuple.\r\n\r\n- also, from the annotation of Cython, it seems some constant values\r\n  such as the list of percentile values to test for threshold will be\r\n  constructed in each iteration of the loop, because the Cython\r\n  compiler cannot be sure that the list will not be modified by\r\n  np.percentile, but since we can be sure, we create the list once\r\n  outside the loop.\r\n\r\nModification verison 2, on 2023-10-05 by Peter Lo <peterloleungyau@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n- modified group_uniqueCounts to group_uniqueCounts_to_arr, to use\r\n  pre-allocated flat numpy array to fill in the counts, instead of\r\n  using list of list.\r\n\r\n- modified tree_node_summary to tree_node_summary_to_arr to use\r\n  pre-allocated flat numpy arrays, and to fill in the node summary in\r\n  new format, which consist of two parallel arrays: out_summary_p for\r\n  [P(Y=1|T=i)...] and out_summary_n for [N(T=i)...], instead of the\r\n  previous list of list.\r\n\r\n- for all the evaluation functions, created the arr_evaluate_*\r\n  versions that uses the new node summary format. Also created\r\n  arr_normI as the counter-part of normI using the new node summary\r\n  format.\r\n\r\n- added some cdef to give type declarations to help speed up some\r\n  calculations.\r\n\r\nModifcation version 3, on 2023-10-06 by Peter Lo <peterloleungyau@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n- combine divideSet_len and group_uniqueCounts_to_arr to be\r\n  group_counts_by_divide, so as to reduce creating intermediate\r\n  objects. This calculates the group counts for the left branch.\r\n\r\n- created tree_node_summary_from_counts from tree_node_summary_to_arr,\r\n  to use pre-calculated group counts (e.g. by group_counts_by_divide).\r\n\r\n- for right branch, calculate the group counts by subtracting the\r\n  group counts of left branch from the total count (pre-calculated\r\n  outside the looping of choosing split points), which should be more\r\n  efficient than looping through the data again.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to **CausalML**?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

This saves some allocations.\n+# \n+# - in finding the best split, we use mostly scalar values\n+#   (e.g. best_col and best_value in favor of one single tuple\n+#   bestAttribute) to keep the current best, and further avoids\n+#   allocating many objects. After finding the best split, we use the\n+#   original divideSet to get the X_l and X_r and subsequently\n+#   best_set_left and best_set_right which are used in subsequent\n+#   construction of subtrees of the left and right branches; and\n+#   calculate bestAttribute as a tuple.\n+# \n+# - also, from the annotation of Cython, it seems some constant values\n+#   such as the list of percentile values to test for threshold will be\n+#   constructed in each iteration of the loop, because the Cython\n+#   compiler cannot be sure that the list will not be modified by\n+#   np.percentile, but since we can be sure, we create the list once\n+#   outside the loop.\n+# \n+# Modification verison 2, on 2023-10-05 by Peter Lo <peterloleungyau@gmail.com>\n+# \n+# - modified group_uniqueCounts to group_uniqueCounts_to_arr, to use\n+#   pre-allocated flat numpy array to fill in the counts, instead of\n+#   using list of list.\n+# \n+# - modified tree_node_summary to tree_node_summary_to_arr to use\n+#   pre-allocated flat numpy arrays, and to fill in the node summary in\n+#   new format, which consist of two parallel arrays: out_summary_p for\n+#   [P(Y=1|T=i)...] and out_summary_n for [N(T=i)...], instead of the\n+#   previous list of list.\n+# \n+# - for all the evaluation functions, created the arr_evaluate_*\n+#   versions that uses the new node summary format. Also created\n+#   arr_normI as the counter-part of normI using the new node summary\n+#   format.\n+# \n+# - added some cdef to give type declarations to help speed up some\n+#   calculations.\n+# \n+# Modifcation version 3, on 2023-10-06 by Peter Lo <peterloleungyau@gmail.com>\n+# \n+# - combine divideSet_len and group_uniqueCounts_to_arr to be\n+#   group_counts_by_divide, so as to reduce creating intermediate\n+#   objects. This calculates the group counts for the left branch.\n+# \n+# - created tree_node_summary_from_counts from tree_node_summary_to_arr,\n+#   to use pre-calculated group counts (e.g. by group_counts_by_divide).\n+# \n+# - for right branch, calculate the group counts by subtracting the\n+#   group counts of left branch from the total count (pre-calculated\n+#   outside the looping of choosing split points), which should be more\n+#   efficient than looping through the data again.",

                "body": "Mainly reduce allocation, in a synthetic data of 40000 rows, about 400 features, 4 treatments, there is a speed up of about 65x over the original version.\r\n\r\nThe main modifications are in the comments, reproduced below for convenience.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nModified to speed up UpliftTreeClassifier.growDecisionTreeFrom and\r\nconsequently can also speed up UpliftTreeClassifier.fit, and\r\nUpliftRandomForestClassifier.\r\n\r\nModification version 1, on 2023-10-04 by Peter Lo <peterloleungyau@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n- created divideSet_len from divideSet, which does not split the whole\r\n  X into X_l and X_r, but returns len(X_l) and len(X_r) instead,\r\n  because in finding the best split, the whole X_l and X_r are not\r\n  used. This saves some allocations.\r\n\r\n- in finding the best split, we use mostly scalar values\r\n  (e.g. best_col and best_value in favor of one single tuple\r\n  bestAttribute) to keep the current best, and further avoids\r\n  allocating many objects. After finding the best split, we use the\r\n  original divideSet to get the X_l and X_r and subsequently\r\n  best_set_left and best_set_right which are used in subsequent\r\n  construction of subtrees of the left and right branches; and\r\n  calculate bestAttribute as a tuple.\r\n\r\n- also, from the annotation of Cython, it seems some constant values\r\n  such as the list of percentile values to test for threshold will be\r\n  constructed in each iteration of the loop, because the Cython\r\n  compiler cannot be sure that the list will not be modified by\r\n  np.percentile, but since we can be sure, we create the list once\r\n  outside the loop.\r\n\r\nModification verison 2, on 2023-10-05 by Peter Lo <peterloleungyau@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n- modified group_uniqueCounts to group_uniqueCounts_to_arr, to use\r\n  pre-allocated flat numpy array to fill in the counts, instead of\r\n  using list of list.\r\n\r\n- modified tree_node_summary to tree_node_summary_to_arr to use\r\n  pre-allocated flat numpy arrays, and to fill in the node summary in\r\n  new format, which consist of two parallel arrays: out_summary_p for\r\n  [P(Y=1|T=i)...] and out_summary_n for [N(T=i)...], instead of the\r\n  previous list of list.\r\n\r\n- for all the evaluation functions, created the arr_evaluate_*\r\n  versions that uses the new node summary format. Also created\r\n  arr_normI as the counter-part of normI using the new node summary\r\n  format.\r\n\r\n- added some cdef to give type declarations to help speed up some\r\n  calculations.\r\n\r\nModifcation version 3, on 2023-10-06 by Peter Lo <peterloleungyau@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n- combine divideSet_len and group_uniqueCounts_to_arr to be\r\n  group_counts_by_divide, so as to reduce creating intermediate\r\n  objects. This calculates the group counts for the left branch.\r\n\r\n- created tree_node_summary_from_counts from tree_node_summary_to_arr,\r\n  to use pre-calculated group counts (e.g. by group_counts_by_divide).\r\n\r\n- for right branch, calculate the group counts by subtracting the\r\n  group counts of left branch from the total count (pre-calculated\r\n  outside the looping of choosing split points), which should be more\r\n  efficient than looping through the data again.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to **CausalML**?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

                "body": "Mainly reduce allocation, in a synthetic data of 40000 rows, about 400 features, 4 treatments, there is a speed up of about 65x over the original version.\r\n\r\nThe main modifications are in the comments, reproduced below for convenience.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nModified to speed up UpliftTreeClassifier.growDecisionTreeFrom and\r\nconsequently can also speed up UpliftTreeClassifier.fit, and\r\nUpliftRandomForestClassifier.\r\n\r\nModification version 1, on 2023-10-04 by Peter Lo <peterloleungyau@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n- created divideSet_len from divideSet, which does not split the whole\r\n  X into X_l and X_r, but returns len(X_l) and len(X_r) instead,\r\n  because in finding the best split, the whole X_l and X_r are not\r\n  used. This saves some allocations.\r\n\r\n- in finding the best split, we use mostly scalar values\r\n  (e.g. best_col and best_value in favor of one single tuple\r\n  bestAttribute) to keep the current best, and further avoids\r\n  allocating many objects. After finding the best split, we use the\r\n  original divideSet to get the X_l and X_r and subsequently\r\n  best_set_left and best_set_right which are used in subsequent\r\n  construction of subtrees of the left and right branches; and\r\n  calculate bestAttribute as a tuple.\r\n\r\n- also, from the annotation of Cython, it seems some constant values\r\n  such as the list of percentile values to test for threshold will be\r\n  constructed in each iteration of the loop, because the Cython\r\n  compiler cannot be sure that the list will not be modified by\r\n  np.percentile, but since we can be sure, we create the list once\r\n  outside the loop.\r\n\r\nModification verison 2, on 2023-10-05 by Peter Lo <peterloleungyau@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n- modified group_uniqueCounts to group_uniqueCounts_to_arr, to use\r\n  pre-allocated flat numpy array to fill in the counts, instead of\r\n  using list of list.\r\n\r\n- modified tree_node_summary to tree_node_summary_to_arr to use\r\n  pre-allocated flat numpy arrays, and to fill in the node summary in\r\n  new format, which consist of two parallel arrays: out_summary_p for\r\n  [P(Y=1|T=i)...] and out_summary_n for [N(T=i)...], instead of the\r\n  previous list of list.\r\n\r\n- for all the evaluation functions, created the arr_evaluate_*\r\n  versions that uses the new node summary format. Also created\r\n  arr_normI as the counter-part of normI using the new node summary\r\n  format.\r\n\r\n- added some cdef to give type declarations to help speed up some\r\n  calculations.\r\n\r\nModifcation version 3, on 2023-10-06 by Peter Lo <peterloleungyau@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n- combine divideSet_len and group_uniqueCounts_to_arr to be\r\n  group_counts_by_divide, so as to reduce creating intermediate\r\n  objects. This calculates the group counts for the left branch.\r\n\r\n- created tree_node_summary_from_counts from tree_node_summary_to_arr,\r\n  to use pre-calculated group counts (e.g. by group_counts_by_divide).\r\n\r\n- for right branch, calculate the group counts by subtracting the\r\n  group counts of left branch from the total count (pre-calculated\r\n  outside the looping of choosing split points), which should be more\r\n  efficient than looping through the data again.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to **CausalML**?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

This saves some allocations.\n+# \n+# - in finding the best split, we use mostly scalar values\n+#   (e.g. best_col and best_value in favor of one single tuple\n+#   bestAttribute) to keep the current best, and further avoids\n+#   allocating many objects. After finding the best split, we use the\n+#   original divideSet to get the X_l and X_r and subsequently\n+#   best_set_left and best_set_right which are used in subsequent\n+#   construction of subtrees of the left and right branches; and\n+#   calculate bestAttribute as a tuple.\n+# \n+# - also, from the annotation of Cython, it seems some constant values\n+#   such as the list of percentile values to test for threshold will be\n+#   constructed in each iteration of the loop, because the Cython\n+#   compiler cannot be sure that the list will not be modified by\n+#   np.percentile, but since we can be sure, we create the list once\n+#   outside the loop.\n+# \n+# Modification verison 2, on 2023-10-05 by Peter Lo <peterloleungyau@gmail.com>\n+# \n+# - modified group_uniqueCounts to group_uniqueCounts_to_arr, to use\n+#   pre-allocated flat numpy array to fill in the counts, instead of\n+#   using list of list.\n+# \n+# - modified tree_node_summary to tree_node_summary_to_arr to use\n+#   pre-allocated flat numpy arrays, and to fill in the node summary in\n+#   new format, which consist of two parallel arrays: out_summary_p for\n+#   [P(Y=1|T=i)...] and out_summary_n for [N(T=i)...], instead of the\n+#   previous list of list.\n+# \n+# - for all the evaluation functions, created the arr_evaluate_*\n+#   versions that uses the new node summary format. Also created\n+#   arr_normI as the counter-part of normI using the new node summary\n+#   format.\n+# \n+# - added some cdef to give type declarations to help speed up some\n+#   calculations.\n+# \n+# Modifcation version 3, on 2023-10-06 by Peter Lo <peterloleungyau@gmail.com>\n+# \n+# - combine divideSet_len and group_uniqueCounts_to_arr to be\n+#   group_counts_by_divide, so as to reduce creating intermediate\n+#   objects. This calculates the group counts for the left branch.\n+# \n+# - created tree_node_summary_from_counts from tree_node_summary_to_arr,\n+#   to use pre-calculated group counts (e.g. by group_counts_by_divide).\n+# \n+# - for right branch, calculate the group counts by subtracting the\n+#   group counts of left branch from the total count (pre-calculated\n+#   outside the looping of choosing split points), which should be more\n+#   efficient than looping through the data again.",

                "body": "Mainly reduce allocation, in a synthetic data of 40000 rows, about 400 features, 4 treatments, there is a speed up of about 65x over the original version.\r\n\r\nThe main modifications are in the comments, reproduced below for convenience.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nModified to speed up UpliftTreeClassifier.growDecisionTreeFrom and\r\nconsequently can also speed up UpliftTreeClassifier.fit, and\r\nUpliftRandomForestClassifier.\r\n\r\nModification version 1, on 2023-10-04 by Peter Lo <peterloleungyau@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n- created divideSet_len from divideSet, which does not split the whole\r\n  X into X_l and X_r, but returns len(X_l) and len(X_r) instead,\r\n  because in finding the best split, the whole X_l and X_r are not\r\n  used. This saves some allocations.\r\n\r\n- in finding the best split, we use mostly scalar values\r\n  (e.g. best_col and best_value in favor of one single tuple\r\n  bestAttribute) to keep the current best, and further avoids\r\n  allocating many objects. After finding the best split, we use the\r\n  original divideSet to get the X_l and X_r and subsequently\r\n  best_set_left and best_set_right which are used in subsequent\r\n  construction of subtrees of the left and right branches; and\r\n  calculate bestAttribute as a tuple.\r\n\r\n- also, from the annotation of Cython, it seems some constant values\r\n  such as the list of percentile values to test for threshold will be\r\n  constructed in each iteration of the loop, because the Cython\r\n  compiler cannot be sure that the list will not be modified by\r\n  np.percentile, but since we can be sure, we create the list once\r\n  outside the loop.\r\n\r\nModification verison 2, on 2023-10-05 by Peter Lo <peterloleungyau@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n- modified group_uniqueCounts to group_uniqueCounts_to_arr, to use\r\n  pre-allocated flat numpy array to fill in the counts, instead of\r\n  using list of list.\r\n\r\n- modified tree_node_summary to tree_node_summary_to_arr to use\r\n  pre-allocated flat numpy arrays, and to fill in the node summary in\r\n  new format, which consist of two parallel arrays: out_summary_p for\r\n  [P(Y=1|T=i)...] and out_summary_n for [N(T=i)...], instead of the\r\n  previous list of list.\r\n\r\n- for all the evaluation functions, created the arr_evaluate_*\r\n  versions that uses the new node summary format. Also created\r\n  arr_normI as the counter-part of normI using the new node summary\r\n  format.\r\n\r\n- added some cdef to give type declarations to help speed up some\r\n  calculations.\r\n\r\nModifcation version 3, on 2023-10-06 by Peter Lo <peterloleungyau@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n- combine divideSet_len and group_uniqueCounts_to_arr to be\r\n  group_counts_by_divide, so as to reduce creating intermediate\r\n  objects. This calculates the group counts for the left branch.\r\n\r\n- created tree_node_summary_from_counts from tree_node_summary_to_arr,\r\n  to use pre-calculated group counts (e.g. by group_counts_by_divide).\r\n\r\n- for right branch, calculate the group counts by subtracting the\r\n  group counts of left branch from the total count (pre-calculated\r\n  outside the looping of choosing split points), which should be more\r\n  efficient than looping through the data again.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to **CausalML**?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

This saves some allocations.\r\n\r\n- in finding the best split, we use mostly scalar values\r\n  (e.g. best_col and best_value in favor of one single tuple\r\n  bestAttribute) to keep the current best, and further avoids\r\n  allocating many objects. After finding the best split, we use the\r\n  original divideSet to get the X_l and X_r and subsequently\r\n  best_set_left and best_set_right which are used in subsequent\r\n  construction of subtrees of the left and right branches; and\r\n  calculate bestAttribute as a tuple.\r\n\r\n- also, from the annotation of Cython, it seems some constant values\r\n  such as the list of percentile values to test for threshold will be\r\n  constructed in each iteration of the loop, because the Cython\r\n  compiler cannot be sure that the list will not be modified by\r\n  np.percentile, but since we can be sure, we create the list once\r\n  outside the loop.\r\n\r\nModification verison 2, on 2023-10-05 by Peter Lo <peterloleungyau@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n- modified group_uniqueCounts to group_uniqueCounts_to_arr, to use\r\n  pre-allocated flat numpy array to fill in the counts, instead of\r\n  using list of list.\r\n\r\n- modified tree_node_summary to tree_node_summary_to_arr to use\r\n  pre-allocated flat numpy arrays, and to fill in the node summary in\r\n  new format, which consist of two parallel arrays: out_summary_p for\r\n  [P(Y=1|T=i)...] and out_summary_n for [N(T=i)...], instead of the\r\n  previous list of list.\r\n\r\n- for all the evaluation functions, created the arr_evaluate_*\r\n  versions that uses the new node summary format. Also created\r\n  arr_normI as the counter-part of normI using the new node summary\r\n  format.\r\n\r\n- added some cdef to give type declarations to help speed up some\r\n  calculations.\r\n\r\nModifcation version 3, on 2023-10-06 by Peter Lo <peterloleungyau@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n- combine divideSet_len and group_uniqueCounts_to_arr to be\r\n  group_counts_by_divide, so as to reduce creating intermediate\r\n  objects. This calculates the group counts for the left branch.\r\n\r\n- created tree_node_summary_from_counts from tree_node_summary_to_arr,\r\n  to use pre-calculated group counts (e.g. by group_counts_by_divide).\r\n\r\n- for right branch, calculate the group counts by subtracting the\r\n  group counts of left branch from the total count (pre-calculated\r\n  outside the looping of choosing split points), which should be more\r\n  efficient than looping through the data again.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to **CausalML**?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

                "body": "Mainly reduce allocation, in a synthetic data of 40000 rows, about 400 features, 4 treatments, there is a speed up of about 65x over the original version.\r\n\r\nThe main modifications are in the comments, reproduced below for convenience.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nModified to speed up UpliftTreeClassifier.growDecisionTreeFrom and\r\nconsequently can also speed up UpliftTreeClassifier.fit, and\r\nUpliftRandomForestClassifier.\r\n\r\nModification version 1, on 2023-10-04 by Peter Lo <peterloleungyau@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n- created divideSet_len from divideSet, which does not split the whole\r\n  X into X_l and X_r, but returns len(X_l) and len(X_r) instead,\r\n  because in finding the best split, the whole X_l and X_r are not\r\n  used. This saves some allocations.\r\n\r\n- in finding the best split, we use mostly scalar values\r\n  (e.g. best_col and best_value in favor of one single tuple\r\n  bestAttribute) to keep the current best, and further avoids\r\n  allocating many objects. After finding the best split, we use the\r\n  original divideSet to get the X_l and X_r and subsequently\r\n  best_set_left and best_set_right which are used in subsequent\r\n  construction of subtrees of the left and right branches; and\r\n  calculate bestAttribute as a tuple.\r\n\r\n- also, from the annotation of Cython, it seems some constant values\r\n  such as the list of percentile values to test for threshold will be\r\n  constructed in each iteration of the loop, because the Cython\r\n  compiler cannot be sure that the list will not be modified by\r\n  np.percentile, but since we can be sure, we create the list once\r\n  outside the loop.\r\n\r\nModification verison 2, on 2023-10-05 by Peter Lo <peterloleungyau@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n- modified group_uniqueCounts to group_uniqueCounts_to_arr, to use\r\n  pre-allocated flat numpy array to fill in the counts, instead of\r\n  using list of list.\r\n\r\n- modified tree_node_summary to tree_node_summary_to_arr to use\r\n  pre-allocated flat numpy arrays, and to fill in the node summary in\r\n  new format, which consist of two parallel arrays: out_summary_p for\r\n  [P(Y=1|T=i)...] and out_summary_n for [N(T=i)...], instead of the\r\n  previous list of list.\r\n\r\n- for all the evaluation functions, created the arr_evaluate_*\r\n  versions that uses the new node summary format. Also created\r\n  arr_normI as the counter-part of normI using the new node summary\r\n  format.\r\n\r\n- added some cdef to give type declarations to help speed up some\r\n  calculations.\r\n\r\nModifcation version 3, on 2023-10-06 by Peter Lo <peterloleungyau@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n- combine divideSet_len and group_uniqueCounts_to_arr to be\r\n  group_counts_by_divide, so as to reduce creating intermediate\r\n  objects. This calculates the group counts for the left branch.\r\n\r\n- created tree_node_summary_from_counts from tree_node_summary_to_arr,\r\n  to use pre-calculated group counts (e.g. by group_counts_by_divide).\r\n\r\n- for right branch, calculate the group counts by subtracting the\r\n  group counts of left branch from the total count (pre-calculated\r\n  outside the looping of choosing split points), which should be more\r\n  efficient than looping through the data again.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to **CausalML**?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.
