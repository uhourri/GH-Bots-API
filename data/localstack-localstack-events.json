Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\n## Motivation\n\nThere was an issue when generating the Lambda resources. It would generate an import path containing the word \"lambda\", which is a reserved keyword in Python. The actual failure was when trying to run `black` over the codebase.\n\n<!-- What notable changes does this PR make? -->\n## Changes\n\n- Use python compatible name for module\n- Sort resource provider list to reduce the number of merge conflicts\n- Add option to not run black, since running black is a common source of errors. It checks the code is valid Python, but sometimes you just want to scaffold a resource and fix the issues yourself. Black will be run on the resulting file anyway.\n\n## Testing\n\n`python -m localstack.services.cloudformation.scaffold generate -r \"AWS::Lambda::Version\"` should work\n\n<!-- The following sections are optional, but can be useful! \n\n\nDescription of how to test the changes\n\n## TODO\n\nWhat's left to do:\n\n- [ ] ...\n- [ ] ...\n\n-->\n\n",

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\n## Motivation\n\nThere was an issue when generating the Lambda resources. It would generate an import path containing the word \"lambda\", which is a reserved keyword in Python. The actual failure was when trying to run `black` over the codebase.\n\n<!-- What notable changes does this PR make? -->\n## Changes\n\n- Use python compatible name for module\n- Sort resource provider list to reduce the number of merge conflicts\n- Add option to not run black, since running black is a common source of errors. It checks the code is valid Python, but sometimes you just want to scaffold a resource and fix the issues yourself. Black will be run on the resulting file anyway.\n\n## Testing\n\n`python -m localstack.services.cloudformation.scaffold generate -r \"AWS::Lambda::Version\"` should work\n\n<!-- The following sections are optional, but can be useful! \n\n\nDescription of how to test the changes\n\n## TODO\n\nWhat's left to do:\n\n- [ ] ...\n- [ ] ...\n\n-->\n\n",

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\n## Motivation\n\nThere was an issue when generating the Lambda resources. It would generate an import path containing the word \"lambda\", which is a reserved keyword in Python. The actual failure was when trying to run `black` over the codebase.\n\n<!-- What notable changes does this PR make? -->\n## Changes\n\n- Use python compatible name for module\n- Sort resource provider list to reduce the number of merge conflicts\n- Add option to not run black, since running black is a common source of errors. It checks the code is valid Python, but sometimes you just want to scaffold a resource and fix the issues yourself. Black will be run on the resulting file anyway.\n\n## Testing\n\n`python -m localstack.services.cloudformation.scaffold generate -r \"AWS::Lambda::Version\"` should work\n\n<!-- The following sections are optional, but can be useful! \n\n\nDescription of how to test the changes\n\n## TODO\n\nWhat's left to do:\n\n- [ ] ...\n- [ ] ...\n\n-->\n\n",

Was there a specific reason it was done this way?\r\n\r\nI don't think this mimics the current behaviour though:\r\n```bash\r\n$ awslocal apigateway get-account\r\n{\r\n    \"cloudwatchRoleArn\": \"arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/api-gw-cw-role\",\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n$ AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=000000000002 awslocal apigateway get-account\r\n{\r\n    \"cloudwatchRoleArn\": \"arn:aws:iam::000000000002:role/api-gw-cw-role\",\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis might create some issues, but I don't think we currently have the CloudWatch integration with APIGW, so it shouldn't be an IAM issue I hope.\r\n\r\nDo you see how this could be achieved with the current architecture? Even a big a refactor in APIGW might not solve this if `ApiGatewayStore.account` is called in different places, we would need to manually update the account after the store instantiation. How can we address this issue? ",
