Introduce a basic framegraph framework for managing renderPasses, while modularizing the existing rendering modules into several core Passes for reuse;\r\n2. Added support for render paths, including Forward (default render path), Deferred (a standard DeferredShading), and TileBasedDeferred (Tile-optimized DeferredShading). They should be compatible with most existing modules.\r\n3. Added some code demos for RenderPath.\r\n\r\nRegarding render paths, please refer to: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/RenderingPaths.html\r\n\r\n### Performance considerations\r\nThe rendering overhead of real-time lights in deferred shading is proportional to the number of pixels illuminated by the light and not dependent on Scene complexity. So small Point Lights or Spot Lights are very cheap to render and if they are fully or partially occluded by Scene GameObjects then they are even cheaper.\r\nOf course, lights with shadows are much more expensive than lights without shadows. In deferred shading, shadow-casting GameObjects still need to be rendered once or more for each shadow-casting light. Furthermore, the lighting shader that applies shadows has a higher rendering overhead than the one used when shadows are disabled.\r\n\r\n### GBuffer format: \r\nRT0, RGBA16F: Pack DiffuseColor, Ao, Alpha\r\nRT1, RGBA16F: Pack SpecularColor, FZero, Roughness\r\nRT2, RGBA16F: Pack ShadingModelId, emissiveColor\r\nRT3, RGBA32F: Pack Normal (contains Normal with TBN transform and modelNormal, using cubemap mapping)\r\nRT4, depth: Pack depth\r\n\r\n### LightPack:\r\nThere are two ways to package lightData, one of which is to use a uniform array, which should be faster, but its quantity is limited, and a large number of light sources will be drawn and accumulated through several passes to complete all light sources;\r\nAnother way is to package all light source information through three texture1D, which may have some performance overhead, but supports a large amount of light source data;\r\n\r\n### Tile-Based DeferredShading:\r\nTileLightDecode: Packs tile information, x indicates the first light source offset used by the tile (for lookup in TileLightIndex), y indicates how many lights are associated with the tile (currently no limit, i.e. unlimited number of lights), z indicates the uv coordinate offset when sampling TileLightIndex for the tile; \r\nTileLightIndex: Packs light source ids for each tile\r\n\r\n### UseRenderPath:\r\nEnable the corresponding renderPath in the following ways\uff1a\r\n`renderManager.setCurMaxDeferredShadingLightNum(1000);// Pre-allocate a maximum value for light sources to ensure the maximum number of light sources in the scene does not exceed this value.\r\n        renderManager.setRenderPath(RenderManager.RenderPath.Deferred);`\r\n\r\n### UseFramegraph:\r\nEnable the corresponding framegraph in the following ways\uff1a\r\n`renderManager.enableFramegraph(true);`",

Introduce a basic framegraph framework for managing renderPasses, while modularizing the existing rendering modules into several core Passes for reuse;\r\n2. Added support for render paths, including Forward (default render path), Deferred (a standard DeferredShading), and TileBasedDeferred (Tile-optimized DeferredShading). They should be compatible with most existing modules.\r\n3. Added some code demos for RenderPath.\r\n\r\nRegarding render paths, please refer to: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/RenderingPaths.html\r\n\r\n### Performance considerations\r\nThe rendering overhead of real-time lights in deferred shading is proportional to the number of pixels illuminated by the light and not dependent on Scene complexity. So small Point Lights or Spot Lights are very cheap to render and if they are fully or partially occluded by Scene GameObjects then they are even cheaper.\r\nOf course, lights with shadows are much more expensive than lights without shadows. In deferred shading, shadow-casting GameObjects still need to be rendered once or more for each shadow-casting light. Furthermore, the lighting shader that applies shadows has a higher rendering overhead than the one used when shadows are disabled.\r\n\r\n### GBuffer format: \r\nRT0, RGBA16F: Pack DiffuseColor, Ao, Alpha\r\nRT1, RGBA16F: Pack SpecularColor, FZero, Roughness\r\nRT2, RGBA16F: Pack ShadingModelId, emissiveColor\r\nRT3, RGBA32F: Pack Normal (contains Normal with TBN transform and modelNormal, using cubemap mapping)\r\nRT4, depth: Pack depth\r\n\r\n### LightPack:\r\nThere are two ways to package lightData, one of which is to use a uniform array, which should be faster, but its quantity is limited, and a large number of light sources will be drawn and accumulated through several passes to complete all light sources;\r\nAnother way is to package all light source information through three texture1D, which may have some performance overhead, but supports a large amount of light source data;\r\n\r\n### Tile-Based DeferredShading:\r\nTileLightDecode: Packs tile information, x indicates the first light source offset used by the tile (for lookup in TileLightIndex), y indicates how many lights are associated with the tile (currently no limit, i.e. unlimited number of lights), z indicates the uv coordinate offset when sampling TileLightIndex for the tile; \r\nTileLightIndex: Packs light source ids for each tile\r\n\r\n### UseRenderPath:\r\nEnable the corresponding renderPath in the following ways\uff1a\r\n`renderManager.setCurMaxDeferredShadingLightNum(1000);// Pre-allocate a maximum value for light sources to ensure the maximum number of light sources in the scene does not exceed this value.\r\n        renderManager.setRenderPath(RenderManager.RenderPath.Deferred);`\r\n\r\n### UseFramegraph:\r\nEnable the corresponding framegraph in the following ways\uff1a\r\n`renderManager.enableFramegraph(true);`",

Introduce a basic framegraph framework for managing renderPasses, while modularizing the existing rendering modules into several core Passes for reuse;\r\n2. Added support for render paths, including Forward (default render path), Deferred (a standard DeferredShading), and TileBasedDeferred (Tile-optimized DeferredShading). They should be compatible with most existing modules.\r\n3. Added some code demos for RenderPath.\r\n\r\nRegarding render paths, please refer to: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/RenderingPaths.html\r\n\r\n### Performance considerations\r\nThe rendering overhead of real-time lights in deferred shading is proportional to the number of pixels illuminated by the light and not dependent on Scene complexity. So small Point Lights or Spot Lights are very cheap to render and if they are fully or partially occluded by Scene GameObjects then they are even cheaper.\r\nOf course, lights with shadows are much more expensive than lights without shadows. In deferred shading, shadow-casting GameObjects still need to be rendered once or more for each shadow-casting light. Furthermore, the lighting shader that applies shadows has a higher rendering overhead than the one used when shadows are disabled.\r\n\r\n### GBuffer format: \r\nRT0, RGBA16F: Pack DiffuseColor, Ao, Alpha\r\nRT1, RGBA16F: Pack SpecularColor, FZero, Roughness\r\nRT2, RGBA16F: Pack ShadingModelId, emissiveColor\r\nRT3, RGBA32F: Pack Normal (contains Normal with TBN transform and modelNormal, using cubemap mapping)\r\nRT4, depth: Pack depth\r\n\r\n### LightPack:\r\nThere are two ways to package lightData, one of which is to use a uniform array, which should be faster, but its quantity is limited, and a large number of light sources will be drawn and accumulated through several passes to complete all light sources;\r\nAnother way is to package all light source information through three texture1D, which may have some performance overhead, but supports a large amount of light source data;\r\n\r\n### Tile-Based DeferredShading:\r\nTileLightDecode: Packs tile information, x indicates the first light source offset used by the tile (for lookup in TileLightIndex), y indicates how many lights are associated with the tile (currently no limit, i.e. unlimited number of lights), z indicates the uv coordinate offset when sampling TileLightIndex for the tile; \r\nTileLightIndex: Packs light source ids for each tile\r\n\r\n### UseRenderPath:\r\nEnable the corresponding renderPath in the following ways\uff1a\r\n`renderManager.setCurMaxDeferredShadingLightNum(1000);// Pre-allocate a maximum value for light sources to ensure the maximum number of light sources in the scene does not exceed this value.\r\n        renderManager.setRenderPath(RenderManager.RenderPath.Deferred);`\r\n\r\n### UseFramegraph:\r\nEnable the corresponding framegraph in the following ways\uff1a\r\n`renderManager.enableFramegraph(true);`",

Introduce a basic framegraph framework for managing renderPasses, while modularizing the existing rendering modules into several core Passes for reuse;\r\n2. Added support for render paths, including Forward (default render path), Deferred (a standard DeferredShading), and TileBasedDeferred (Tile-optimized DeferredShading). They should be compatible with most existing modules.\r\n3. Added some code demos for RenderPath.\r\n\r\nRegarding render paths, please refer to: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/RenderingPaths.html\r\n\r\n### Performance considerations\r\nThe rendering overhead of real-time lights in deferred shading is proportional to the number of pixels illuminated by the light and not dependent on Scene complexity. So small Point Lights or Spot Lights are very cheap to render and if they are fully or partially occluded by Scene GameObjects then they are even cheaper.\r\nOf course, lights with shadows are much more expensive than lights without shadows. In deferred shading, shadow-casting GameObjects still need to be rendered once or more for each shadow-casting light. Furthermore, the lighting shader that applies shadows has a higher rendering overhead than the one used when shadows are disabled.\r\n\r\n### GBuffer format: \r\nRT0, RGBA16F: Pack DiffuseColor, Ao, Alpha\r\nRT1, RGBA16F: Pack SpecularColor, FZero, Roughness\r\nRT2, RGBA16F: Pack ShadingModelId, emissiveColor\r\nRT3, RGBA32F: Pack Normal (contains Normal with TBN transform and modelNormal, using cubemap mapping)\r\nRT4, depth: Pack depth\r\n\r\n### LightPack:\r\nThere are two ways to package lightData, one of which is to use a uniform array, which should be faster, but its quantity is limited, and a large number of light sources will be drawn and accumulated through several passes to complete all light sources;\r\nAnother way is to package all light source information through three texture1D, which may have some performance overhead, but supports a large amount of light source data;\r\n\r\n### Tile-Based DeferredShading:\r\nTileLightDecode: Packs tile information, x indicates the first light source offset used by the tile (for lookup in TileLightIndex), y indicates how many lights are associated with the tile (currently no limit, i.e. unlimited number of lights), z indicates the uv coordinate offset when sampling TileLightIndex for the tile; \r\nTileLightIndex: Packs light source ids for each tile\r\n\r\n### UseRenderPath:\r\nEnable the corresponding renderPath in the following ways\uff1a\r\n`renderManager.setCurMaxDeferredShadingLightNum(1000);// Pre-allocate a maximum value for light sources to ensure the maximum number of light sources in the scene does not exceed this value.\r\n        renderManager.setRenderPath(RenderManager.RenderPath.Deferred);`\r\n\r\n### UseFramegraph:\r\nEnable the corresponding framegraph in the following ways\uff1a\r\n`renderManager.enableFramegraph(true);`",

Introduce a basic framegraph framework for managing renderPasses, while modularizing the existing rendering modules into several core Passes for reuse;\r\n2. Added support for render paths, including Forward (default render path), Deferred (a standard DeferredShading), and TileBasedDeferred (Tile-optimized DeferredShading). They should be compatible with most existing modules.\r\n3. Added some code demos for RenderPath.\r\n\r\nRegarding render paths, please refer to: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/RenderingPaths.html\r\n\r\n### Performance considerations\r\nThe rendering overhead of real-time lights in deferred shading is proportional to the number of pixels illuminated by the light and not dependent on Scene complexity. So small Point Lights or Spot Lights are very cheap to render and if they are fully or partially occluded by Scene GameObjects then they are even cheaper.\r\nOf course, lights with shadows are much more expensive than lights without shadows. In deferred shading, shadow-casting GameObjects still need to be rendered once or more for each shadow-casting light. Furthermore, the lighting shader that applies shadows has a higher rendering overhead than the one used when shadows are disabled.\r\n\r\n### GBuffer format: \r\nRT0, RGBA16F: Pack DiffuseColor, Ao, Alpha\r\nRT1, RGBA16F: Pack SpecularColor, FZero, Roughness\r\nRT2, RGBA16F: Pack ShadingModelId, emissiveColor\r\nRT3, RGBA32F: Pack Normal (contains Normal with TBN transform and modelNormal, using cubemap mapping)\r\nRT4, depth: Pack depth\r\n\r\n### LightPack:\r\nThere are two ways to package lightData, one of which is to use a uniform array, which should be faster, but its quantity is limited, and a large number of light sources will be drawn and accumulated through several passes to complete all light sources;\r\nAnother way is to package all light source information through three texture1D, which may have some performance overhead, but supports a large amount of light source data;\r\n\r\n### Tile-Based DeferredShading:\r\nTileLightDecode: Packs tile information, x indicates the first light source offset used by the tile (for lookup in TileLightIndex), y indicates how many lights are associated with the tile (currently no limit, i.e. unlimited number of lights), z indicates the uv coordinate offset when sampling TileLightIndex for the tile; \r\nTileLightIndex: Packs light source ids for each tile\r\n\r\n### UseRenderPath:\r\nEnable the corresponding renderPath in the following ways\uff1a\r\n`renderManager.setCurMaxDeferredShadingLightNum(1000);// Pre-allocate a maximum value for light sources to ensure the maximum number of light sources in the scene does not exceed this value.\r\n        renderManager.setRenderPath(RenderManager.RenderPath.Deferred);`\r\n\r\n### UseFramegraph:\r\nEnable the corresponding framegraph in the following ways\uff1a\r\n`renderManager.enableFramegraph(true);`",

Introduce a basic framegraph framework for managing renderPasses, while modularizing the existing rendering modules into several core Passes for reuse;\r\n2. Added support for render paths, including Forward (default render path), Deferred (a standard DeferredShading), and TileBasedDeferred (Tile-optimized DeferredShading). They should be compatible with most existing modules.\r\n3. Added some code demos for RenderPath.\r\n\r\nRegarding render paths, please refer to: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/RenderingPaths.html\r\n\r\n### Performance considerations\r\nThe rendering overhead of real-time lights in deferred shading is proportional to the number of pixels illuminated by the light and not dependent on Scene complexity. So small Point Lights or Spot Lights are very cheap to render and if they are fully or partially occluded by Scene GameObjects then they are even cheaper.\r\nOf course, lights with shadows are much more expensive than lights without shadows. In deferred shading, shadow-casting GameObjects still need to be rendered once or more for each shadow-casting light. Furthermore, the lighting shader that applies shadows has a higher rendering overhead than the one used when shadows are disabled.\r\n\r\n### GBuffer format: \r\nRT0, RGBA16F: Pack DiffuseColor, Ao, Alpha\r\nRT1, RGBA16F: Pack SpecularColor, FZero, Roughness\r\nRT2, RGBA16F: Pack ShadingModelId, emissiveColor\r\nRT3, RGBA32F: Pack Normal (contains Normal with TBN transform and modelNormal, using cubemap mapping)\r\nRT4, depth: Pack depth\r\n\r\n### LightPack:\r\nThere are two ways to package lightData, one of which is to use a uniform array, which should be faster, but its quantity is limited, and a large number of light sources will be drawn and accumulated through several passes to complete all light sources;\r\nAnother way is to package all light source information through three texture1D, which may have some performance overhead, but supports a large amount of light source data;\r\n\r\n### Tile-Based DeferredShading:\r\nTileLightDecode: Packs tile information, x indicates the first light source offset used by the tile (for lookup in TileLightIndex), y indicates how many lights are associated with the tile (currently no limit, i.e. unlimited number of lights), z indicates the uv coordinate offset when sampling TileLightIndex for the tile; \r\nTileLightIndex: Packs light source ids for each tile\r\n\r\n### UseRenderPath:\r\nEnable the corresponding renderPath in the following ways\uff1a\r\n`renderManager.setCurMaxDeferredShadingLightNum(1000);// Pre-allocate a maximum value for light sources to ensure the maximum number of light sources in the scene does not exceed this value.\r\n        renderManager.setRenderPath(RenderManager.RenderPath.Deferred);`\r\n\r\n### UseFramegraph:\r\nEnable the corresponding framegraph in the following ways\uff1a\r\n`renderManager.enableFramegraph(true);`",

Introduce a basic framegraph framework for managing renderPasses, while modularizing the existing rendering modules into several core Passes for reuse;\r\n2. Added support for render paths, including Forward (default render path), Deferred (a standard DeferredShading), and TileBasedDeferred (Tile-optimized DeferredShading). They should be compatible with most existing modules.\r\n3. Added some code demos for RenderPath.\r\n\r\nRegarding render paths, please refer to: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/RenderingPaths.html\r\n\r\n### Performance considerations\r\nThe rendering overhead of real-time lights in deferred shading is proportional to the number of pixels illuminated by the light and not dependent on Scene complexity. So small Point Lights or Spot Lights are very cheap to render and if they are fully or partially occluded by Scene GameObjects then they are even cheaper.\r\nOf course, lights with shadows are much more expensive than lights without shadows. In deferred shading, shadow-casting GameObjects still need to be rendered once or more for each shadow-casting light. Furthermore, the lighting shader that applies shadows has a higher rendering overhead than the one used when shadows are disabled.\r\n\r\n### GBuffer format: \r\nRT0, RGBA16F: Pack DiffuseColor, Ao, Alpha\r\nRT1, RGBA16F: Pack SpecularColor, FZero, Roughness\r\nRT2, RGBA16F: Pack ShadingModelId, emissiveColor\r\nRT3, RGBA32F: Pack Normal (contains Normal with TBN transform and modelNormal, using cubemap mapping)\r\nRT4, depth: Pack depth\r\n\r\n### LightPack:\r\nThere are two ways to package lightData, one of which is to use a uniform array, which should be faster, but its quantity is limited, and a large number of light sources will be drawn and accumulated through several passes to complete all light sources;\r\nAnother way is to package all light source information through three texture1D, which may have some performance overhead, but supports a large amount of light source data;\r\n\r\n### Tile-Based DeferredShading:\r\nTileLightDecode: Packs tile information, x indicates the first light source offset used by the tile (for lookup in TileLightIndex), y indicates how many lights are associated with the tile (currently no limit, i.e. unlimited number of lights), z indicates the uv coordinate offset when sampling TileLightIndex for the tile; \r\nTileLightIndex: Packs light source ids for each tile\r\n\r\n### UseRenderPath:\r\nEnable the corresponding renderPath in the following ways\uff1a\r\n`renderManager.setCurMaxDeferredShadingLightNum(1000);// Pre-allocate a maximum value for light sources to ensure the maximum number of light sources in the scene does not exceed this value.\r\n        renderManager.setRenderPath(RenderManager.RenderPath.Deferred);`\r\n\r\n### UseFramegraph:\r\nEnable the corresponding framegraph in the following ways\uff1a\r\n`renderManager.enableFramegraph(true);`",
