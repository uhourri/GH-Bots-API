I'm somewhat familiar with the underlying C++ OCCT, and I'm more than happy to contribute code. I'm filing this issue so we can discuss and align on the best approach here.\r\n\r\nHere's a self-contained demo of the approach I found so far:\r\nhttps://github.com/mkovaxx/cadquery_fused_assembly/tree/4572a63616a614f3920c859b5224c8d4aaed3d64\r\n\r\nI create each face as a separate shape, then pass it to the `Assembly.add` method along with its desired color. Saving the assembly as STEP then contains the colors as expected.\r\n\r\nFor details, see this section:\r\nhttps://github.com/mkovaxx/cadquery_fused_assembly/blob/4572a63616a614f3920c859b5224c8d4aaed3d64/src/tubes.py#L22-L37\r\n\r\nHowever, this approach has two severe limitations.\r\n\r\nFirst, the output contains topologically disconnected shells. I expected this to be resolved by setting `ExportModes.FUSED` on the `Assembly.save` method, unfortunately that does not help.\r\n\r\nSecond, the output contains no volumes. There doesn't seem to be a way to get around this without extending CadQuery in some way.",
