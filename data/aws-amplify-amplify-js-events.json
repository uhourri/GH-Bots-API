                "body": "This RFC outlines the changes coming in the Amplify Library v6 developer preview. The v6 launch will focus on 3 key areas:\r\n\r\n1. Smaller bundle size (thanks for contributing to #10727)\r\n2. Improved TypeScript support (thanks for contributing to #11113)\r\n3. Improved Next.js support, including App Router, API Routes, middleware, and more.\r\n\r\nWe'd love to use this RFC to collect your feedback as we rollout new functionalities to this preview before general availability.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Moving from v5 to v6 is a breaking change. Follow the migration guide on the bottom of this comment to learn more. As of the time of writing, v6 is still in developer preview and should not be used for production workloads. \r\n\r\n# New enhancements\r\n\r\n## Improved Bundle Sizes\r\n\r\n- Use a new function-based developer experience instead of a class-based one to enable better tree shaking and reduce bundle sizes\r\n- Leverage tree shaking to only import code from Amplify categories actually used in the app\r\n\r\n## Enhanced TypeScript Support\r\n\r\n- Added TypeScript definitions for Auth, Analytics, and Storage categories\r\n- In an upcoming update: Expanded TypeScript support to all categories including GraphQL API and REST APIs\r\n\r\n## Improved Next.js support (App Router, API routes, middleware)\r\n\r\n- A new \"Next.js adapter\" package to support key Next.js capabilities like SSR, middleware, API routes\r\n- Use Amplify Library securely in Next.js apps via `runWithAmplifyServerContext` callback\r\n\r\n## Provide Feedback\r\nWe welcome your input on the proposed changes! Please try the Amplify Library v6 developer preview and share feedback by commenting on this RFC.\r\n\r\n# How to get started\r\n\r\nTo get started install the v6 preview of Amplify JS using the `@next` tag:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install aws-amplify@next\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a step-by-step walkthrough to use Amplify JS v6 preview in your Next.js, React, Vue.js, or Angular.js app, [check out our documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib-v1/project-setup/create-application/q/platform/js/).\r\n\r\n# How to migrate from v5 -> v6 Developer Preview\r\n\r\nYou can review the full migration guide on [our v6 (Preview) documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib-v1/project-setup/create-application/q/platform/js/). The primary steps are summarized below:\r\n\r\nTo upgrade to the v6 developer preview. Install the `@next` tagged version of Amplify JS:\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install aws-amplify@next\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of importing specific classes from a parent package, you must now import the specific functionalities from subpaths:\r\n\r\n**Before in v5**\r\n```js\r\nimport { Amplify, Auth } from 'aws-amplify'\r\nimport awsconfig from './aws-exports'\r\n\r\nAmplify.configure(awsconfig)\r\n\r\n...\r\nAuth.signIn(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Now in v6**\r\n```js\r\nimport { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify'\r\nimport { signIn } from 'aws-amplify/auth'\r\nimport awsconfig from './aws-exports'\r\n\r\nAmplify.configure(awsconfig)\r\n\r\n...\r\nsignIn(...)\r\n```\r\n",

                "body": "Hi @Meags27 & @Duckinm \r\n\r\nBoth of you had some issues configuring Amplify for the serve side use case in your Next.js project. We are exploring a different approach to do so, to avoid altering next.config.js and want to get your thoughts on this! And everyone else is welcome to comment with their feedback!\r\n\r\n**Proposed Approach**\r\n\r\n1. Create an `amplifyUtils.ts` file in your codebase with the following content:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { createServerRunner } from '@aws-amplify/adapter-nextjs';\r\nimport config from './amplifyconfiguration.json';\r\n\r\nexport const runWithAmplifyServerContext = createServerRunner({\r\n  config,\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Use the `createServerRunner` returned `runWithAmplifyServerContext` function to call Amplify APIs on the server side, for example, calling fetchAuthSession in a server component\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers';\r\nimport { fetchAuthSession } from 'aws-amplify/auth/server';\r\n\r\nimport { runWithAmplifyServerContext } from './amplifyUtils';\r\n\r\nexport default async function APage() {\r\n  const session = await runWithAmplifyServerContext({\r\n    nextServerContext: { cookies },\r\n    operation: (contextSpec) => fetchAuthSession(contextSpect),\r\n  });\r\n  \r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      {JSON.stringify(session, null, 2)}\r\n    <div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe differences compared to the APIs in the current developer preview are:\r\n\r\n1. Updates to `next.config.js` are no longer required.\r\n2. Instead of directly using `runWithAmplifyServerContext` provided by `@aws-amplify/adapter-nextjs`, you will need to create this function by using the `createServerRunner` function along with the `amplifyconfiguration.json`.\r\n\r\nWith this proposed approach, we are moving away to `next.config`, and the issue raised with `next.config.(js| cjs|mjs)` will be resolved.\r\n",

To support our current use case we are needing to do federated login via a popup as it is being integrated via an iframe. It would be great if this could be supported natively for the web API.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nA solution similar to that provided by [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/auth0-single-page-app-sdk#login-with-popup) would be great where it is part of the SDK. I believe here they exchange the code in the oauth flow through window messaging.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nI have looked into implementing a customer `urlOpener` as part of the configuration but this does not work as it is not able to communicate back to the parent window for the authentication exchange as this is more in the internals of the Amplify API.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is this something that you'd be interested in working on?\n\n- [ ] \ud83d\udc4b I may be able to implement this feature request\n- [ ] \u26a0\ufe0f This feature might incur a breaking change",

We want to be able to surface our application within another one and iframes are how that is being done. We want to also ensure though that only certain users are allowed to access our customer application hence why we have our own layer of authentication. The team that owns the application that we are embedding into have provided an example of the popup workflow which works as intended and I know they are using Auth0 hence why I referenced it.",

Request call site, such as `client.models.Widget.get({authMode: 'apiKey'})`\r\n2. Client created with `generateClient({authMode: 'apiKey'})`\r\n3.

Please provide a description above and review\r\nthe requirements below.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR duplicates the Push Notification types from the native module as it is unfortunately not feasible to rely on an optional package as a source of truth since typescript will attempt to fully analyze all types whether used or not when `skipLibCheck` is disabled.\r\n\r\n#### Description of how you validated changes\r\n* Published to Verdaccio and verified that app previously failing `tsc` is now passing\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.

Please provide a description above and review\r\nthe requirements below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdds optional `authMode` and `authToken` params to `generateClient()`.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst client = generateClient<Schema>({\r\n  amplify: Amplify,\r\n  authMode: 'lambda',\r\n  authToken: 'some-token',\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will take precedence over configured auth details. Auth details provided at the request-level take precedence over client auth.\r\n\r\nAuth config is evaluated in this order, for each of `authMode` and `authToken`, where the first defined value is used:\r\n\r\n1. Request call site, such as `client.models.Widget.get({authMode: 'apiKey'})`\r\n2. Client created with `generateClient({authMode: 'apiKey'})`\r\n3. Configuration from `Amplify.configure(...)`\r\n\r\n#### Issue #, if available\r\n<!-- Also, please reference any associated PRs for documentation updates. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Description of how you validated changes\r\n\r\n1.

Please provide a description above and review\r\nthe requirements below.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR duplicates the Push Notification types from the native module as it is unfortunately not feasible to rely on an optional package as a source of truth since typescript will attempt to fully analyze all types whether used or not when `skipLibCheck` is disabled.\r\n\r\n#### Description of how you validated changes\r\n* Published to Verdaccio and verified that app previously failing `tsc` is now passing\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.

Please provide a description above and review\r\nthe requirements below.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR duplicates the Push Notification types from the native module as it is unfortunately not feasible to rely on an optional package as a source of truth since typescript will attempt to fully analyze all types whether used or not when `skipLibCheck` is disabled.\r\n\r\n#### Description of how you validated changes\r\n* Published to Verdaccio and verified that app previously failing `tsc` is now passing\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.

I get errors instead. Also if I try to get the user object, it says I'm not signed in.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  data: { createTask: null },\r\n  errors: [\r\n    {\r\n      path: [Array],\r\n      data: null,\r\n      errorType: 'Unauthorized',\r\n      errorInfo: null,\r\n      locations: [Array],\r\n      message: 'Not Authorized to access createTask on type Mutation'\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Reproduction steps\r\n\r\n1. Create a Remix App\r\n2. Enable Amplify Auth (I went through Studio)\r\n3. Enable local auth (withAuthenticator)\r\n4. Create a GraphQL API\r\n5. Create a Remix action for creating a new data instance\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Snippet\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Form\r\nimport { Form } from 'remix'\r\nimport { TextField, Button } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react'\r\n\r\nexport default function CreateTask () {\r\n  return (\r\n    <Form method='post' action='/tasks'>\r\n      <TextField name='task' label='Create a task' />\r\n      <Button marginTop='10px' type='submit' variation='default'>Create</Button>\r\n    </Form>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Action\r\nimport { redirect } from 'remix'\r\nimport { withSSRContext } from 'aws-amplify'\r\nimport { createTask } from '../../src/graphql/mutations'\r\n\r\nexport async function action ({ request }) {\r\n  const body = await request.formData()\r\n  const SSR = withSSRContext(request)\r\n\r\n  const user = await SSR.Auth.currentAuthenticatedUser()\r\n\r\n  await SSR.API.graphql({\r\n    query: createTask,\r\n    variables: {\r\n      input: {\r\n        name: body._fields.task[0],\r\n        done: false\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  return redirect('/')\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```gql\r\ntype Task @model  @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner }]) {\r\n  done: Boolean!\r\n  dueDate: AWSDateTime\r\n  name: String!\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Log output\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Put your logs below this line\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### aws-exports.js\r\n\r\n```\r\n/* eslint-disable */\r\n// WARNING: DO NOT EDIT.

It just gets reported as nodejs and the IP of the server. Might not be an issue for you, but if anyone knows how that would be great.\r\n- By default the amplify withSSRContext Auth keeps the user details on `cognitoUser.pool.storage.store` and I these are meant to be applied to a cookie in your reponse, which is then read in the request on the cookie.\r\n- We wanted to keep these internal (on DynamoDB), so instead we locally forked `withSSRContext` to just accept the values directly.\r\n\r\nMaybe Amplify 6 might be more Remix friendly when it comes out?\r\n",
