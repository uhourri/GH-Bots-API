I only see 1 option in the Entry conditions wit the title `header options`. (which is the wrong one). \r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n1. Having also the handle exposed when selecting entry conditions would make it a lot easier to know what field you're dealing with\r\n1.

The logic seems to fit: Many writes to the table from different db connections. The transactional approach should take care of this but not in this case it seems.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNo db table corruption\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n500 Server errors on the front-end and in the CMS when doing any action that interacts with the `matrixblocks` db table.\r\n\r\n### DB Version\r\n\r\nControl panel reports: `MySQL 5.5.5`  \r\nBut `SELECT VERSION();` reports: `10.6.12-MariaDB-0ubuntu0.22.04.1`\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\nThe fix suggested here works and rebuilds the broken db index: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37153406/need-assistance-in-repair-of-corrupted-inndob-table which is essentially just:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nALTER TABLE matrixblocks ENGINE=InnoDB;\r\n```\n\n### Craft CMS version\n\n4.3.3\n\n### PHP version\n\n8.1.2\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nUbuntu 22\n\n### Database type and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Image driver and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installed plugins and versions\n\n_No response_",

But you\u2019re welcome to suggest it in a [new discussion](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/new?category=ideas).\r\n\r\nWell in this case because the title is filled through FeedMe, and used as an identifier since entries can only be matched by Title in Feed Me.

The logic seems to fit: Many writes to the table from different db connections. The transactional approach should take care of this but not in this case it seems.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNo db table corruption\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n500 Server errors on the front-end and in the CMS when doing any action that interacts with the `matrixblocks` db table.\r\n\r\n### DB Version\r\n\r\nControl panel reports: `MySQL 5.5.5`  \r\nBut `SELECT VERSION();` reports: `10.6.12-MariaDB-0ubuntu0.22.04.1`\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\nThe fix suggested here works and rebuilds the broken db index: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37153406/need-assistance-in-repair-of-corrupted-inndob-table which is essentially just:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nALTER TABLE matrixblocks ENGINE=InnoDB;\r\n```\n\n### Craft CMS version\n\n4.3.3\n\n### PHP version\n\n8.1.2\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nUbuntu 22\n\n### Database type and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Image driver and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installed plugins and versions\n\n_No response_",

I know it is a required field, but why make it possible to hide it if it is always required? Maybe it should be auto-filled by another field or anything?\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nThe Title field becomes visible and is editable.\r\n\r\n### Craft CMS version\r\n\r\n4.5.9\r\n\r\n### PHP version\r\n\r\n8.2\r\n\r\n### Operating system and version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Database type and version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Image driver and version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Installed plugins and versions\r\n\r\n_No response_",

I know it is a required field, but why make it possible to hide it if it is always required? Maybe it should be auto-filled by another field or anything?\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nThe Title field becomes visible and is editable.\r\n\r\n### Craft CMS version\r\n\r\n4.5.9\r\n\r\n### PHP version\r\n\r\n8.2\r\n\r\n### Operating system and version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Database type and version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Image driver and version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Installed plugins and versions\r\n\r\n_No response_",

I know it is a required field, but why make it possible to hide it if it is always required? Maybe it should be auto-filled by another field or anything?\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nThe Title field becomes visible and is editable.\r\n\r\n### Craft CMS version\r\n\r\n4.5.9\r\n\r\n### PHP version\r\n\r\n8.2\r\n\r\n### Operating system and version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Database type and version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Image driver and version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Installed plugins and versions\r\n\r\n_No response_",

All of the entries in this section are imported and updated via a FeedMe import. As we ran into performance issues with Craft's native search we were trying to make less fields available to the search index. So we reduced the number of searchable fields and ran\r\n\r\n`craft resave/entries --update-search-index --section object --limit 10000` (The limit of 10.000 was just a test, we are planning to run the same command for all entries).\r\n\r\nBefore calling this command we ran this SQL query to get the sizes of all tables to compare before and after.\r\n\r\n```\r\n> SELECT\r\n    table_name as \"Table\",\r\n    table_rows as \"Rows\",\r\n    data_length as \"Length\",\r\n    index_length as \"Index\",\r\n    round(((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024),2) as \"Size (mb)\"\r\nFROM information_schema.TABLES\r\nWHERE table_schema = '%%NAME OF YOUR CRAFT DB%%'\r\nORDER BY `Size (mb)` DESC;\r\n+----------------------------+--------+-----------+----------+-----------+\r\n| Table                      | Rows   | Length    | Index    | Size (mb) |\r\n+----------------------------+--------+-----------+----------+-----------+\r\n| searchindex                | 714985 | 103481344 | 37339136 |    134.30 |\r\n| content                    | 122278 |  80330752 | 12140544 |     88.19 |\r\n| changedfields              | 278828 |  12075008 | 27328512 |     37.58 |\r\n| elements_sites             | 130086 |  14172160 | 18432000 |     31.09 |\r\n| elements                   |  64341 |   7880704 | 19038208 |     25.67 |\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the command finished, we ran the query again:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> SELECT\r\n    table_name as \"Table\",\r\n    table_rows as \"Rows\",\r\n    data_length as \"Length\",\r\n    index_length as \"Index\",\r\n    round(((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024),2) as \"Size (mb)\"\r\nFROM information_schema.TABLES\r\nWHERE table_schema = '%%NAME OF YOUR CRAFT DB%%'\r\nORDER BY `Size (mb)` DESC;\r\n+----------------------------+--------+-----------+----------+-----------+\r\n| Table                      | Rows   | Length    | Index    | Size (mb) |\r\n+----------------------------+--------+-----------+----------+-----------+\r\n| searchindex                | 438577 | 103464960 | 37257216 |    134.20 |\r\n| changedfields              | 534244 |  38354944 | 62029824 |     95.73 |\r\n| content                    | 122278 |  80330752 | 12140544 |     88.19 |\r\n| elements_sites             | 130086 |  14172160 | 18432000 |     31.09 |\r\n| elements                   |  64341 |   7880704 | 19038208 |     25.67 |\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the `changedfields` table grew with a factor of 2.5x.

All of the entries in this section are imported and updated via a FeedMe import. As we ran into performance issues with Craft's native search we were trying to make less fields available to the search index. So we reduced the number of searchable fields and ran\r\n\r\n`craft resave/entries --update-search-index --section object --limit 10000` (The limit of 10.000 was just a test, we are planning to run the same command for all entries).\r\n\r\nBefore calling this command we ran this SQL query to get the sizes of all tables to compare before and after.\r\n\r\n```\r\n> SELECT\r\n    table_name as \"Table\",\r\n    table_rows as \"Rows\",\r\n    data_length as \"Length\",\r\n    index_length as \"Index\",\r\n    round(((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024),2) as \"Size (mb)\"\r\nFROM information_schema.TABLES\r\nWHERE table_schema = '%%NAME OF YOUR CRAFT DB%%'\r\nORDER BY `Size (mb)` DESC;\r\n+----------------------------+--------+-----------+----------+-----------+\r\n| Table                      | Rows   | Length    | Index    | Size (mb) |\r\n+----------------------------+--------+-----------+----------+-----------+\r\n| searchindex                | 714985 | 103481344 | 37339136 |    134.30 |\r\n| content                    | 122278 |  80330752 | 12140544 |     88.19 |\r\n| changedfields              | 278828 |  12075008 | 27328512 |     37.58 |\r\n| elements_sites             | 130086 |  14172160 | 18432000 |     31.09 |\r\n| elements                   |  64341 |   7880704 | 19038208 |     25.67 |\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the command finished, we ran the query again:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> SELECT\r\n    table_name as \"Table\",\r\n    table_rows as \"Rows\",\r\n    data_length as \"Length\",\r\n    index_length as \"Index\",\r\n    round(((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024),2) as \"Size (mb)\"\r\nFROM information_schema.TABLES\r\nWHERE table_schema = '%%NAME OF YOUR CRAFT DB%%'\r\nORDER BY `Size (mb)` DESC;\r\n+----------------------------+--------+-----------+----------+-----------+\r\n| Table                      | Rows   | Length    | Index    | Size (mb) |\r\n+----------------------------+--------+-----------+----------+-----------+\r\n| searchindex                | 438577 | 103464960 | 37257216 |    134.20 |\r\n| changedfields              | 534244 |  38354944 | 62029824 |     95.73 |\r\n| content                    | 122278 |  80330752 | 12140544 |     88.19 |\r\n| elements_sites             | 130086 |  14172160 | 18432000 |     31.09 |\r\n| elements                   |  64341 |   7880704 | 19038208 |     25.67 |\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the `changedfields` table grew with a factor of 2.5x. If we had resaved all of the entries in this section we would easily have come up with a table of over 200mb in size.\r\n\r\nNow we were interested to see what fields are saved in the `changedfields` table:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> SELECT COUNT(*) as num_search_entry, f.handle\r\nFROM changedfields c, fields f\r\nWHERE c.fieldId = f.id\r\nGROUP BY f.handle\r\nORDER BY num_search_entry DESC;\r\n+------------------+-----------------------------+\r\n| num_search_entry | handle                      |\r\n+------------------+-----------------------------+\r\n|            37552 | objectImages                |\r\n|            23916 | objectInventory             |\r\n|            23916 | objectId                    |\r\n|            23915 | objectArtist                |\r\n|            23622 | objectRelation              |\r\n|            23622 | objectLiterature            |\r\n|            23622 | objectOnDisplay             |\r\n|            23622 | objectDateStart             |\r\n|            23622 | objectDateEnd               |\r\n|            20599 | objectDescription           |\r\n|            20597 | objectDate                  |\r\n|            20597 | objectLocality              |\r\n|            20597 | objectDimensions            |\r\n|            20597 | objectAcquisition           |\r\n|            20597 | objectMaterial              |\r\n|            20597 | objectLocation              |\r\n|            20308 | objectProvenance            |\r\n|            20303 | objectPlacement             |\r\n|            20303 | objectTerm                  |\r\n|             1645 | linkField                   |\r\n|             1579 | description                 |\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, all of those fields are used for this entry type. `linkField` and `description` are two fields used for other sections/entry types.\r\n\r\nWe couldn't find much information about what the `changedfields` table actually does and whether it is safe to truncate it.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated.\n\n### Craft CMS version\n\n4.5.6.1\n\n### PHP version\n\n8.0/8.2\n\n### Operating system and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Database type and version\n\nMariaDB\n\n### Image driver and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installed plugins and versions\n\n- FeedMe",

The table size isn\u2019t going to cause any issues besides taking up extra space on disk.\r\n\r\nAs you've seen, this table is already half the size of our db, hence we'd really like to get rid of useless information stored in the db. In our case we know that all fields starting with `object` (e.g. `objectImages`) will be imported by FeedMe.

The logic seems to fit: Many writes to the table from different db connections. The transactional approach should take care of this but not in this case it seems.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNo db table corruption\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n500 Server errors on the front-end and in the CMS when doing any action that interacts with the `matrixblocks` db table.\r\n\r\n### DB Version\r\n\r\nControl panel reports: `MySQL 5.5.5`  \r\nBut `SELECT VERSION();` reports: `10.6.12-MariaDB-0ubuntu0.22.04.1`\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\nThe fix suggested here works and rebuilds the broken db index: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37153406/need-assistance-in-repair-of-corrupted-inndob-table which is essentially just:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nALTER TABLE matrixblocks ENGINE=InnoDB;\r\n```\n\n### Craft CMS version\n\n4.3.3\n\n### PHP version\n\n8.1.2\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nUbuntu 22\n\n### Database type and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Image driver and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installed plugins and versions\n\n_No response_",

The logic seems to fit: Many writes to the table from different db connections. The transactional approach should take care of this but not in this case it seems.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNo db table corruption\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n500 Server errors on the front-end and in the CMS when doing any action that interacts with the `matrixblocks` db table.\r\n\r\n### DB Version\r\n\r\nControl panel reports: `MySQL 5.5.5`  \r\nBut `SELECT VERSION();` reports: `10.6.12-MariaDB-0ubuntu0.22.04.1`\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\nThe fix suggested here works and rebuilds the broken db index: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37153406/need-assistance-in-repair-of-corrupted-inndob-table which is essentially just:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nALTER TABLE matrixblocks ENGINE=InnoDB;\r\n```\n\n### Craft CMS version\n\n4.3.3\n\n### PHP version\n\n8.1.2\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nUbuntu 22\n\n### Database type and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Image driver and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installed plugins and versions\n\n_No response_",

                "body": "In way of an update from our point of view, the plan over here now is to side-step the issue and move to MySQL 8.x. I have been experimenting with switching between MariaDB and dockerised MySQL - doing it this way has meant I can test / prove the system by having both running, with different data directories and listening on different port numbers. Switching between them for testing is trivial.\r\n\r\nIt's not great seeing how much of a performance difference there is. We used to have query cache switched on for MariaDB which was concealing things a bit, but switching that off and levelling the playing field still results in around a 15-30% drop in performance depending what particular CMS screen / front end page we are testing. Our TTFB timings are not good enough yet. I am sure that the larger differences are down to things specific to our sites, especially on our front-end(s), so we are working through all the issues we can before we do the move.\r\n\r\nThere are few technical advantages to doing this switch, a somewhat tenuous one of note is one that the MySQL docs specifically talk about: consistency. MariaDB may query things faster on average but times for each specific query may vary a lot, especially with the query cache active. MySQL is far more consistent in it's query times.",

The logic seems to fit: Many writes to the table from different db connections. The transactional approach should take care of this but not in this case it seems.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNo db table corruption\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n500 Server errors on the front-end and in the CMS when doing any action that interacts with the `matrixblocks` db table.\r\n\r\n### DB Version\r\n\r\nControl panel reports: `MySQL 5.5.5`  \r\nBut `SELECT VERSION();` reports: `10.6.12-MariaDB-0ubuntu0.22.04.1`\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\nThe fix suggested here works and rebuilds the broken db index: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37153406/need-assistance-in-repair-of-corrupted-inndob-table which is essentially just:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nALTER TABLE matrixblocks ENGINE=InnoDB;\r\n```\n\n### Craft CMS version\n\n4.3.3\n\n### PHP version\n\n8.1.2\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nUbuntu 22\n\n### Database type and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Image driver and version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installed plugins and versions\n\n_No response_",
