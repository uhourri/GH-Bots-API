On the other side this still can happen because we only define we want to have an zulu Java 20 version, if after testing and before release another minor is released, the same would happen.\r\n\r\nTherefore we should pin the exact version and update it semi-automatically (create an PR) using an bot so we have full control over it.\r\n\n\n### Considered Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

All timestamps for files, i.e. created/modified/accessed, are updated to current time when copied. For the folders the modified date timestamp is kept but the created date is changed to current time. This seems only to occur for SD cards and USB sticks. For hard disks (HD and SD drives) all works normally, also when the drives are connected with external USB enclosures. \n\n### What software is involved?\n\n- Operating System: Windows 10 English\r\n- Cryptomator: v1.91 and v1.92 with WinFsp v1.x (included in exe installer) and with WinFsp upgraded to winfsp-2.0.23075.msi\r\n- Different SD Cards, USB sticks and Hard Disk Drives\n\n### Volume Type\n\nWinFsp\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Install Cryptomator on a HDD (with WinFsp as volume type).\r\n2. Create a test vault on the HDD.\r\n3. Open the vault and copy some files/folders from the HDD into the vault. Timestamps will be preserved. \r\n4. Close the vault, and copy it to a USB stick and/or SD Card. \r\n5. Open the vault in the new location and copy some files/folders from the HDD into it. All file timestamps will be updated to current time. \r\n6.  See further \"Anything else?\" below.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nFile and folder timestamps to be preserved. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nFile and folder timestamps were not preserved. \n\n### Reproducibility\n\nAlways\n\n### Relevant Log Output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\nSame timestamp behavior when the vault is created directly on the SD card or USB stick and files are copied to it from a HDD. \r\n\r\nThis seems to occur only for SD cards and USB sticks. For hard disks (HD and SD drives) all works normally, also when the HDD is connected over an external USB enclosures. Tested several different times/ways and all worked well with HDD. ",

Yesterday (I do not use the Android app frequently!) I found many of these, about 20... I thought they were some leftover from the DB migration from v6 to v7, so I have:\r\n- moved everything from the vault locally on my pc\r\n- unmounted the vault\r\n- the vault size was zero but a few folders were still there, deleting wasn't possibile\r\n- on the actual Dropbox folder 99,9% of subfolders were 0 bytes, a few about 30 bytes\r\n- deleted the actual Dropbox subfolders of \"d\"\r\n- re-mounted the vault, now empty both from pc and Android\r\n- moved back on vault everything from the local copy on pc\r\n- at first the vault wasn't showing any \"strange\" files on Android\r\n\r\nToday I saw the above TWO! :-(\r\nBTW: I use FreeFileSync to save the vault on a safe place on my pc, this software creates and deletes many \"temporary files\"... could it be the problem?\r\n\r\n[PC_cryptomator0_20201126_1430.zip](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/files/5603496/PC_cryptomator0_20201126_1430.zip)\r\n[Phone_logs_20201126_1405.zip](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/files/5603499/Phone_logs_20201126_1405.zip)\r\n",
