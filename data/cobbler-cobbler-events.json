                "body": "### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nHey Folks and @SchoolGuy , I hope you're doing well.  Thanks for all that you're doing with Cobbler.\r\nI've migrated from Cobbler 2.8.5 on CentOS 7.9 to Cobbler 3.3.3-1.el9 on AlmalLinux 9.2\r\n\r\nCobbler 2.8.5. was super stable.\r\nCobbler 3.3.3 has a number of issues and I'll start filing some bugs\r\n\r\n(What I'd like to do is publish a modern Cobbler Tutorial Series)\r\n\r\nBUG:\r\n\r\nI have a Kickstart file (both for AlmaLinux 8 and AlmaLinux 9) with the following line: \r\n`url --url=$tree`\r\n\r\nHowever, the variable '$tree' never gets its value substituted as a result, the PXE installation fails with the following message:\r\n\r\ndracut-initqueue: Warning: Invalid value for 'inst.repo': $tree\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/assets/684506/075c9104-73bc-4e3b-b637-2d71aa3e7c3b)\r\n\r\nAs a result, it  cannot find the RPM tree to do a Kickstart installation\r\n\r\n\r\nI found out that it wasn't substituting the variable by running the 'get-autoinstall' script:\r\n`cobbler profile get-autoinstall --name $ProfileName`\r\n\r\n**The workaround is to change the value for 'url --url=$xyz**\r\n\r\nI changed:\r\nurl --url=$tree\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\nurl --url=http://$IP_ADDRESS_OF_COBBLER_SERVER/cblr/links/$DISTRO_NAME_IN_COBBLER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Download the Distro:\r\n\r\nmkdir /distros\r\ncd /distros\r\nwget http://mirror.myaccess.ca/8.8/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-8.8-x86_64-dvd.iso\r\nmount -o loop /distros/AlmaLinux-8.8-x86_64-dvd.iso /mnt\r\ncobbler import --path=/mnt --name=almalinux88-x86_64\r\numount /mnt\r\nrm AlmaLinux-8.8-x86_64-dvd.iso\r\n\r\n2. Do all your /etc/cobbler/* configurations\r\n3. Create the Kickstart / Autoinstall file: /var/lib/cobbler/templates/almalinux8-cobbler-install.ks \r\n\r\n```\r\n# Sample kickstart file for current EL, Fedora based distributions.\r\n\r\n#platform=x86, AMD64, or Intel EM64T\r\n# System authorization information\r\nauthselect  --useshadow  --enablemd5\r\n# System bootloader configuration\r\nbootloader --location=mbr\r\n# Partition clearing information\r\nclearpart --all --initlabel\r\n# Use text mode install\r\ntext\r\n# Firewall configuration\r\nfirewall --enabled\r\n# Run the Setup Agent on first boot\r\nfirstboot --disable\r\n# System keyboard\r\nkeyboard us\r\n# System language\r\nlang en_US\r\n# Use network installation\r\nurl --url=$tree\r\n# If any cobbler repo definitions were referenced in the kickstart profile, include them here.\r\n$yum_repo_stanza\r\n# Network information\r\n$SNIPPET('network_config')\r\n# Reboot after installation\r\nreboot\r\n\r\n#Root password\r\nrootpw --iscrypted $default_password_crypted\r\n# SELinux configuration\r\nselinux --disabled\r\n# Do not configure the X Window System\r\nskipx\r\n# System timezone\r\ntimezone  America/Vancouver --isUtc\r\n# Clear the Master Boot Record\r\nzerombr\r\n# Allow anaconda to partition the system as needed\r\nautopart\r\n\r\n%pre\r\n$SNIPPET('log_ks_pre')\r\n$SNIPPET('autoinstall_start')\r\n$SNIPPET('pre_install_network_config')\r\n# Enable installation monitoring\r\n$SNIPPET('pre_anamon')\r\n%end\r\n\r\n\r\n%packages\r\n@^minimal-environment\r\nkexec-tools\r\n%end\r\n\r\n\r\n%post --nochroot\r\n$SNIPPET('log_ks_post_nochroot')\r\n%end\r\n\r\n%post\r\n$SNIPPET('log_ks_post')\r\n# Start yum configuration\r\n$yum_config_stanza\r\n# End yum configuration\r\n$SNIPPET('post_install_kernel_options')\r\n$SNIPPET('post_install_network_config')\r\n$SNIPPET('download_config_files')\r\n$SNIPPET('koan_environment')\r\n$SNIPPET('redhat_register')\r\n$SNIPPET('cobbler_register')\r\n# Enable post-install boot notification\r\n$SNIPPET('post_anamon')\r\n# Start final steps\r\n$SNIPPET('autoinstall_done')\r\n# End final steps\r\n%end\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Create a Cobbler Profile for the AlmaLinux 8 distor and this kickstart file:\r\n\r\ncobbler profile add --name=almalinux8-cobbler-install --distro=almalinux88-x86_64 --autoinstall=almalinux8-cobbler-install.ks\r\n\r\n5. run 'cobbler sync'\r\n6. Create a VM and start to PXE boot off the profil e\r\n\r\nAt this point, you will see this error.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt should kickstart AlmaLinux 8\r\n\r\n### Cobbler version\r\n\r\n<!--- Paste output from `cobbler version` -->\r\n````cobbler version\r\nCobbler 3.3.3\r\n  source: ?, ?\r\n  build time: Tue Jun 14 00:00:00 2022\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\n<!--- On which operating system do you use Cobbler? -->\r\ncat /etc/almalinux-release \r\nAlmaLinux release 9.2 (Turquoise Kodkod)\r\n\r\n### Cobbler log\r\n\r\nThe logs was massive so I searched for the string 'tree' and maybe this is whats relevant (?): \r\n\r\n<!--- Paste (partial) output from `/var/log/cobbler/cobbler.log` -->\r\n````\r\n[{'code': 'VFFSL(SL,\"tree\",True)',\r\n  'exc_val': NotFound(\"cannot find 'tree'\"),\r\n  'lineCol': (23, 12),\r\n  'rawCode': '$tree',\r\n  'time': 'Thu Oct 26 14:53:02 2023'}]\r\n\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!--- Add any other context about the problem here. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n**RESOLUTION / workaround is to change the value for 'url --url=$xyz**\r\n\r\nI changed:\r\n`url --url=$tree\r\n`\r\nto\r\n\r\n`url --url=http://$IP_ADDRESS_OF_COBBLER_SERVER/cblr/links/$DISTRO_NAME_IN_COBBLER`",

                "body": "### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nHey Folks and @SchoolGuy , I hope you're doing well.  Thanks for all that you're doing with Cobbler.\r\nI've migrated from Cobbler 2.8.5 on CentOS 7.9 to Cobbler 3.3.3-1.el9 on AlmalLinux 9.2\r\n\r\nCobbler 2.8.5. was super stable.\r\nCobbler 3.3.3 has a number of issues and I'll start filing some bugs\r\n\r\n(What I'd like to do is publish a modern Cobbler Tutorial Series)\r\n\r\nBUG:\r\n\r\nI have a Kickstart file (both for AlmaLinux 8 and AlmaLinux 9) with the following line: \r\n`url --url=$tree`\r\n\r\nHowever, the variable '$tree' never gets its value substituted as a result, the PXE installation fails with the following message:\r\n\r\ndracut-initqueue: Warning: Invalid value for 'inst.repo': $tree\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/assets/684506/075c9104-73bc-4e3b-b637-2d71aa3e7c3b)\r\n\r\nAs a result, it  cannot find the RPM tree to do a Kickstart installation\r\n\r\n\r\nI found out that it wasn't substituting the variable by running the 'get-autoinstall' script:\r\n`cobbler profile get-autoinstall --name $ProfileName`\r\n\r\n**The workaround is to change the value for 'url --url=$xyz**\r\n\r\nI changed:\r\nurl --url=$tree\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\nurl --url=http://$IP_ADDRESS_OF_COBBLER_SERVER/cblr/links/$DISTRO_NAME_IN_COBBLER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Download the Distro:\r\n\r\nmkdir /distros\r\ncd /distros\r\nwget http://mirror.myaccess.ca/8.8/isos/x86_64/AlmaLinux-8.8-x86_64-dvd.iso\r\nmount -o loop /distros/AlmaLinux-8.8-x86_64-dvd.iso /mnt\r\ncobbler import --path=/mnt --name=almalinux88-x86_64\r\numount /mnt\r\nrm AlmaLinux-8.8-x86_64-dvd.iso\r\n\r\n2. Do all your /etc/cobbler/* configurations\r\n3. Create the Kickstart / Autoinstall file: /var/lib/cobbler/templates/almalinux8-cobbler-install.ks \r\n\r\n```\r\n# Sample kickstart file for current EL, Fedora based distributions.\r\n\r\n#platform=x86, AMD64, or Intel EM64T\r\n# System authorization information\r\nauthselect  --useshadow  --enablemd5\r\n# System bootloader configuration\r\nbootloader --location=mbr\r\n# Partition clearing information\r\nclearpart --all --initlabel\r\n# Use text mode install\r\ntext\r\n# Firewall configuration\r\nfirewall --enabled\r\n# Run the Setup Agent on first boot\r\nfirstboot --disable\r\n# System keyboard\r\nkeyboard us\r\n# System language\r\nlang en_US\r\n# Use network installation\r\nurl --url=$tree\r\n# If any cobbler repo definitions were referenced in the kickstart profile, include them here.\r\n$yum_repo_stanza\r\n# Network information\r\n$SNIPPET('network_config')\r\n# Reboot after installation\r\nreboot\r\n\r\n#Root password\r\nrootpw --iscrypted $default_password_crypted\r\n# SELinux configuration\r\nselinux --disabled\r\n# Do not configure the X Window System\r\nskipx\r\n# System timezone\r\ntimezone  America/Vancouver --isUtc\r\n# Clear the Master Boot Record\r\nzerombr\r\n# Allow anaconda to partition the system as needed\r\nautopart\r\n\r\n%pre\r\n$SNIPPET('log_ks_pre')\r\n$SNIPPET('autoinstall_start')\r\n$SNIPPET('pre_install_network_config')\r\n# Enable installation monitoring\r\n$SNIPPET('pre_anamon')\r\n%end\r\n\r\n\r\n%packages\r\n@^minimal-environment\r\nkexec-tools\r\n%end\r\n\r\n\r\n%post --nochroot\r\n$SNIPPET('log_ks_post_nochroot')\r\n%end\r\n\r\n%post\r\n$SNIPPET('log_ks_post')\r\n# Start yum configuration\r\n$yum_config_stanza\r\n# End yum configuration\r\n$SNIPPET('post_install_kernel_options')\r\n$SNIPPET('post_install_network_config')\r\n$SNIPPET('download_config_files')\r\n$SNIPPET('koan_environment')\r\n$SNIPPET('redhat_register')\r\n$SNIPPET('cobbler_register')\r\n# Enable post-install boot notification\r\n$SNIPPET('post_anamon')\r\n# Start final steps\r\n$SNIPPET('autoinstall_done')\r\n# End final steps\r\n%end\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Create a Cobbler Profile for the AlmaLinux 8 distor and this kickstart file:\r\n\r\ncobbler profile add --name=almalinux8-cobbler-install --distro=almalinux88-x86_64 --autoinstall=almalinux8-cobbler-install.ks\r\n\r\n5. run 'cobbler sync'\r\n6. Create a VM and start to PXE boot off the profil e\r\n\r\nAt this point, you will see this error.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt should kickstart AlmaLinux 8\r\n\r\n### Cobbler version\r\n\r\n<!--- Paste output from `cobbler version` -->\r\n````cobbler version\r\nCobbler 3.3.3\r\n  source: ?, ?\r\n  build time: Tue Jun 14 00:00:00 2022\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\n<!--- On which operating system do you use Cobbler? -->\r\ncat /etc/almalinux-release \r\nAlmaLinux release 9.2 (Turquoise Kodkod)\r\n\r\n### Cobbler log\r\n\r\nThe logs was massive so I searched for the string 'tree' and maybe this is whats relevant (?): \r\n\r\n<!--- Paste (partial) output from `/var/log/cobbler/cobbler.log` -->\r\n````\r\n[{'code': 'VFFSL(SL,\"tree\",True)',\r\n  'exc_val': NotFound(\"cannot find 'tree'\"),\r\n  'lineCol': (23, 12),\r\n  'rawCode': '$tree',\r\n  'time': 'Thu Oct 26 14:53:02 2023'}]\r\n\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!--- Add any other context about the problem here. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n**RESOLUTION / workaround is to change the value for 'url --url=$xyz**\r\n\r\nI changed:\r\n`url --url=$tree\r\n`\r\nto\r\n\r\n`url --url=http://$IP_ADDRESS_OF_COBBLER_SERVER/cblr/links/$DISTRO_NAME_IN_COBBLER`",
