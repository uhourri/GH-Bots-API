See these workflow runs for working and non-working results:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/iconduit/html-webpack-plugin/actions/runs/6516561925/job/17700204695#step:5:10 (not working under `5.78.0`)\r\n- https://github.com/iconduit/html-webpack-plugin/actions/runs/6516564935/job/17700211008#step:5:10 (working under `5.77.0`)\r\n\r\nMy Webpack config is pretty simple: \r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst HtmlPlugin = require(\"html-webpack-plugin\");\r\nconst IconduitHtmlPlugin = require(\"../../../src/index.js\");\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  mode: \"development\",\r\n  plugins: [\r\n    new HtmlPlugin(),\r\n    new IconduitHtmlPlugin({\r\n      manifestPath: \"./src/assets/site.iconduitmanifest\",\r\n    }),\r\n  ],\r\n  module: {\r\n    rules: [\r\n      {\r\n        test: /\\.(png|svg|xml|webmanifest)$/,\r\n        type: \"asset/resource\",\r\n      },\r\n    ],\r\n  },\r\n  output: {\r\n    assetModuleFilename: \"[name].[contenthash][ext][query]\",\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I think is happening, is that my plugin is adding a `.xml` and `.webmanifest` asset to the build, but despite the above module rules that should match these and mark them as `asset/resource`, the rules are ignored for some reason.\r\n\r\nIt's also completely possible that I'm doing something the wrong way in my plugin. Any help would be greatly appreciated \ud83d\ude4f\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\nThe Webpack build should succeed. In particular, it seems like the `rules` section of the Webpack config is being ignored for assets that are emitted by the plugin.\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  `v5.78.0`\r\nNode.js version: `v20.8.0`\r\nOperating System: N/A\r\nAdditional tools: N/A\r\n",
