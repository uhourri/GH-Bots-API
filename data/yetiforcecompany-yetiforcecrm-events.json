The start date is later then the end date!\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Go to 'Contact'\r\n2. Click on ' + on the Calendar'\r\n3. Set a meeting start date and end date\r\n4. Click 'Save'\r\n5. Go back to the same contact.\r\n6. See error in the calendar widget.  The meeting date is one day later but the end date is correct.  But that also means the start date of a meeting is later than the end date!\r\n\r\nThank you.",
