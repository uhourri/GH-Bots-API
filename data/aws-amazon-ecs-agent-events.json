We'll then log all encountered errors. This will be helpful for having unit tests since otherwise we wouldn't know whether or not there were any issues.\r\n* `agent/taskresource`: Added new getters within the `Volume` interface. This is to avoid typecasting the volume within the `NodeGetVolumeMetrics` as mentioned in [#3929](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent/pull/3929).\r\n* `agent/stats/engine_unix.go`: No longer type casting the task volume within `fetchEBSVolumeMetrics` in order to obtain the EBS volume and will instead use the getters implemented in `agent/taskresource`\r\n\r\nRelated PR: https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent/pull/3929\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nNew unit tests:\r\n* TestFetchEBSVolumeMetricsHappy\r\n* TestFetchEBSVolumeMetricsUnhappy\r\n* TestFetchEBSVolumeMetricsNoTimeoutError\r\n* TestFetchEBSVolumeMetricsTimeoutError\r\n* TestUnstageVolumesHappy\r\n* TestUnstageVolumesUnhappy\r\n* TestUnstageVolumesNoTimeoutError\r\n* TestUnstageVolumesTimeoutError\r\n\r\nNew tests cover the changes: Yes\r\n\r\n### Description for the changelog\r\nAdded more unit testing for NodeUnstageVolume and NodeGetVolumeMetrics as well as address other leftover TODOs  for EBS-backed task\r\n\r\n### Licensing\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n",

This will cause the generation of ec2 dependencies like `aws-sdk-go` to be created in the `ecs-agent` module.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n`make test && make run-integ-tests`\r\n\r\nNew tests cover the changes: no\r\n\r\n### Description for the changelog\r\n\r\nMove ec2 module to shared library\r\n\r\n**Does this PR include breaking model changes? If so, Have you added transformation functions?**\r\nno\r\n\r\n### Licensing\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n",

This code comes directly from https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver and is used to create a minimal Node-specific driver.\r\n\r\n### Implementation details\r\nThe driver is updated to use the public.ecr.aws/eks-distro-build-tooling/eks-distro-minimal-base-csi-ebs base image which contains all requisite mount utilities in the path while still keeping the overall driver to ~50mb in size. The NodeStage implementation adds only the files and dependencies which are directly tied to the EBS volume Mount/format/fs resize.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nManual test process:\r\n\r\n- attach an ebs volume to EC2 host\r\n- built CSI Driver Image using Dockerfile\r\n- started driver as an ecs-agent Managed Daemon\r\n- called NodeStage from ecs-agent-based csiclient with hard coded device name and volume ID\r\n- validated the mount succeeds with xfs filesystem type.\r\n\r\nNew tests cover the changes: no\r\n\r\n### Description for the changelog\r\nUpdate Minimal CSI Driver with NodeStage method.\r\n\r\n### Licensing\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n",

We'll then log all encountered errors. This will be helpful for having unit tests since otherwise we wouldn't know whether or not there were any issues.\r\n* `agent/taskresource`: Added new getters within the `Volume` interface. This is to avoid typecasting the volume within the `NodeGetVolumeMetrics` as mentioned in [#3929](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent/pull/3929).\r\n* `agent/stats/engine_unix.go`: No longer type casting the task volume within `fetchEBSVolumeMetrics` in order to obtain the EBS volume and will instead use the getters implemented in `agent/taskresource`\r\n\r\nRelated PR: https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent/pull/3929\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nNew unit tests:\r\n* TestFetchEBSVolumeMetricsHappy\r\n* TestFetchEBSVolumeMetricsUnhappy\r\n* TestFetchEBSVolumeMetricsNoTimeoutError\r\n* TestFetchEBSVolumeMetricsTimeoutError\r\n* TestUnstageVolumesHappy\r\n* TestUnstageVolumesUnhappy\r\n* TestUnstageVolumesNoTimeoutError\r\n* TestUnstageVolumesTimeoutError\r\n\r\nNew tests cover the changes: Yes\r\n\r\n### Description for the changelog\r\nAdded more unit testing for NodeUnstageVolume and NodeGetVolumeMetrics as well as address other leftover TODOs  for EBS-backed task\r\n\r\n### Licensing\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n",
