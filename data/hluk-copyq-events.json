Please describe.**\r\nPlease, add a possibility to use mouse buttons as shortcuts, for example, long click on the middle (wheel) button could be used to \"Show main window under mouse cursor\".\r\n\r\nTo date, mice are not limited to 3 buttons, there are those that have up to 19 of them, and the number of combinations reaches up to 40. Of course, you can assign a specific keyboard shortcut to certain actions in CopyQ, and then use the mouse software to assign them to its buttons. But through keyboard shortcuts it is impossible to assign the duration of key presses, but the duration of mouse button presses can be registered, and therefore it will be much more convenient when you can assign 2 actions to one mouse button, for example, a long press of the middle button will perform \"Show main window under mouse cursor\", and a short click will perform \"Show/hide main window\".",
