This, in most cases, is a distinct disincentive to spam the network. The primary reason one might leverage additional/invalid messages here is to either create and exploit temporary view splits OR to compound such messages with additional bugs to wreak havic (e.g. if there is a caching issue that creates and irreparable chain split).\r\n\r\nGiven these messages are not a part of the consensus and due to the impact of adding slashing conditions, it was decided to *not* incorporate any such slashable offenses in Deneb, but the conversation around if these should be added later continues to bubble up.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of potential offenses/slashings:\r\n1. Creating duplicate side-cars for a given slot/index. This is the most obvious anti-spam prevention and would lead to easy rules to follow and easy conditions to validate on-chain\r\n2. Creating invalid side-cars -- e.g. sidecars for indices beyond the amount of blobs in the block. This is a *much* more complex type of condition to encode in your anti-slashing DBs as well as to verify on chain.\r\n\r\nThe complexity and risks around (2) seem not a worthwhile path to go down.\r\n\r\nI am personally open to the discussion of (1), but by default, I am resistant to getting into VC anti-slashing DBs and coding this into the core consensus just due to the complexity, and as @dankrad noted, the additional risks it adds to running a validator and thus continue to disincentivize less professional players from validating.\r\n",

This, in most cases, is a distinct disincentive to spam the network. The primary reason one might leverage additional/invalid messages here is to either create and exploit temporary view splits OR to compound such messages with additional bugs to wreak havic (e.g. if there is a caching issue that creates and irreparable chain split).\r\n\r\nGiven these messages are not a part of the consensus and due to the impact of adding slashing conditions, it was decided to *not* incorporate any such slashable offenses in Deneb, but the conversation around if these should be added later continues to bubble up.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of potential offenses/slashings:\r\n1. Creating duplicate side-cars for a given slot/index. This is the most obvious anti-spam prevention and would lead to easy rules to follow and easy conditions to validate on-chain\r\n2. Creating invalid side-cars -- e.g. sidecars for indices beyond the amount of blobs in the block. This is a *much* more complex type of condition to encode in your anti-slashing DBs as well as to verify on chain.\r\n\r\nThe complexity and risks around (2) seem not a worthwhile path to go down.\r\n\r\nI am personally open to the discussion of (1), but by default, I am resistant to getting into VC anti-slashing DBs and coding this into the core consensus just due to the complexity, and as @dankrad noted, the additional risks it adds to running a validator and thus continue to disincentivize less professional players from validating.\r\n",

                "body": "> The fact that a proposer can cause these splits \r\n\r\nOriginal discussion about the possibility to split the network: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/3244#discussion_r1109156321\r\n\r\nA core point to remember here is that we're talking about colluding dishonest successive proposers, ie those that have private connections between each other - otherwise, with a correctly implemented cache, the correct blobs will eventually reach all participants on gossipsub.\r\n\r\n> they're responsible for an outsized amount of uploading happening at once\r\n\r\nnot quite - you cannot forward an attestation for a block that you haven't fully observed and validated, so either you don't forward the attestation or you forward it to 8 peers at most (on average) - this means that the rpc access pattern will _broadly_ follow attestation propagation patterns. If clients \"hold\" the attestation in a quarantine/short queue and only rebroadcast it once they've observed the valid blobs, we get an even network usage balance which in general uses less bandwidth for spreading the correct blobs than than gossipsub in general (because no duplicates will be sent). Of course, this requires said quarantine to be implemented in clients, which today is not required (it's recommended though to deal with block vs attestation race conditions).\r\n\r\n> cache\r\n\r\ncaches are indeed the most tricky part here - in particular, we don't specify well in the spec what to do with `IGNORE` stuff once we determine its status (VALID or REJECT) - the correct thing to do at that point (for any message, not just blobs) is to clear IGNORE from the libp2p cache and rebroadcast it (to peers that haven't observed the correct version yet), but this needs to be written down and ideally tested.\r\n\r\nTaking a step back, IGNORE is used for any condition whose adherence to the protocol cannot be determined at that time - for example an attestation whose block we haven't seen, a block whose parent we haven't seen or indeed a blob whose block we haven't seen. \r\n\r\nAll these situations _eventually_ resolve themselves and an efficient client must keep track of that resolution in order not to spam the network but also in order for the network to efficiently reach a steady valid state - for example, if you haven't observed a block and later observe it and determine it's invalid, you need to store this \"invalid\" state in a semi-permanent store (ie at least in memory until shutdown with some high upper bound on number of messages you keep track of) because the libp2p message cache is not sufficient to protect against _the same_ message spreading again on the network, specially during non-finality (or indeed from the client shooting itself in the bandwidth foot and re-requesting it as it chases some weird block history).\r\n\r\nThus, the important point to remember here is that the majority of clients operating on the network already need to be correct and .. \"minimally efficient\" - ie that they are bug-free and have well-implemented caches - but this is not a new assumption - an inefficient implementation of the spec, if it were in majority, can still take down the network and render it unstable, slashing conditions or no (similar to how slow a slow EL block can throw off the network as clients take time to validate / execute them).\r\n\r\nMy original proposal for splitting blobs included the following condition: \r\n\r\n> -- If full verification of the blob fails at a later processing stage, clients MUST clear the blob from this \"seen\" cache so as to allow a the valid blob to propagate. The next block producer MAY orphan the block if they have observed multiple blobs signed by the proposer for the same \"seen\" tuple.\r\n\r\nIt was deemed unnecessary to specify because of the second half being difficult to analyze, but the first half still remains necessary for efficient blob propagation (ie it's part of the \"minimally efficient\" implicit stuff that unfortunately is not specified but still needs to happen). \r\n\r\nI'm happy to readd it (ie `If full verification of the blob fails at a later processing stage, clients MUST clear the blob from this \"seen\" cache so as to allow a the valid blob to propagate.`) as a spec condition if it helps implementers.\r\n\r\n",

The default is to require optimal finalization (every 2 epochs).\r\n- `REORG_HEAD_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` is set to 20% (half of the proposer boost) so that an attacker must control up to `PROPOSER_BOOST_SCORE - REORG_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` = 20% of attester weight in order to perform an ex-ante reorg. The attack works by releasing attestations for the block at slot `N + 1` around the same time as the honest proposer publishes the attempted reorg block at `N + 2`. The late attestations tip the weight of the `N + 1` block from `< REORG_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` to `> PROPOSER_BOOST_SCORE`, meaning that block `N + 1` will be preferred to block `N + 2`.\r\n- `REORG_PARENT_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` is set to 160% so that an attacker that is hoarding attestations cannot cause the attempted re-org to fail. For details of this calculation see: https://ethresear.ch/t/selfish-mining-in-pos/15551.\r\n\r\nFor background on the development of this idea, see: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/2860.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n\r\n- Completely optional for clients and node operators, can be switched on and off via a flag. Low risk.\r\n- Can be rolled out almost immediately unlike other late block mitigations which are still in R&D.\r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n\r\n- Considerable complexity, particularly regarding the overriding of fork choice updates for the canonical head.\r\n- Obsoleted by `(block, slot)` fork choice. If a viable implementation of `(block, slot)` fork choice emerges then reorging late blocks will become the default behaviour.\r\n- Relies on proposer boost, which may be phased out in favour of other fork choice changes (e.g. view-merge).\r\n\r\nThanks to @potuz @mkalinin @terencechain @fradamt @casparschwa @djrtwo for feedback on this idea.",

This, in most cases, is a distinct disincentive to spam the network. The primary reason one might leverage additional/invalid messages here is to either create and exploit temporary view splits OR to compound such messages with additional bugs to wreak havic (e.g. if there is a caching issue that creates and irreparable chain split).\r\n\r\nGiven these messages are not a part of the consensus and due to the impact of adding slashing conditions, it was decided to *not* incorporate any such slashable offenses in Deneb, but the conversation around if these should be added later continues to bubble up.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of potential offenses/slashings:\r\n1. Creating duplicate side-cars for a given slot/index. This is the most obvious anti-spam prevention and would lead to easy rules to follow and easy conditions to validate on-chain\r\n2. Creating invalid side-cars -- e.g. sidecars for indices beyond the amount of blobs in the block. This is a *much* more complex type of condition to encode in your anti-slashing DBs as well as to verify on chain.\r\n\r\nThe complexity and risks around (2) seem not a worthwhile path to go down.\r\n\r\nI am personally open to the discussion of (1), but by default, I am resistant to getting into VC anti-slashing DBs and coding this into the core consensus just due to the complexity, and as @dankrad noted, the additional risks it adds to running a validator and thus continue to disincentivize less professional players from validating.\r\n",

                "body": "> they're responsible for an outsized amount of uploading happening at once\r\n\r\nI think this is a real problem. We lose an invariant that we have today. Currently a valid block that is received by any validator is properly synced and committed to DB. With the current gossip conditions we lose this property: a perfectly valid block (albeit from a malicious or buggy proposer) may be rejected by honest validators. The problem here is that if the next proposer actually received the right blobs and did sync the block on time, every validator that had rejected this block will trigger an RPC request. \r\n\r\n- This is an entirely new P2P phenomenon to which we have no data as far as I know gathered. And it is fairly complicated to gather such data in a devnet environment. \r\n- This makes the situation for the next proposer quite precarious as well, his block, no matter how timely, will take much longer to be synced by the part of the network that did receive the bad blobs first. This makes it likely to lose proposer boost and therefore be subject a depth 3 reorg if the next proposer is malicious. \r\n\r\nThe fact that a proposer can cause these splits without penalization (and slashing doesn't seem to completely solve this issue) makes me think that binding blobs to blocks should be taken seriously. There were mostly some concerns about bandwidth that led to unbundle them, however I think these are serious forkchoice issues that we can immediately solve by tying them, at the same time, code complexity on clients (something we hadn't really gauged when we decided to unbundle them) is now clear that becomes simpler with many less edge cases and caches to keep track of equivocating or spurious blobs. It does look like a large refactor, but mostly for a much simpler, less bug prone codebase. ",

This, in most cases, is a distinct disincentive to spam the network. The primary reason one might leverage additional/invalid messages here is to either create and exploit temporary view splits OR to compound such messages with additional bugs to wreak havic (e.g. if there is a caching issue that creates and irreparable chain split).\r\n\r\nGiven these messages are not a part of the consensus and due to the impact of adding slashing conditions, it was decided to *not* incorporate any such slashable offenses in Deneb, but the conversation around if these should be added later continues to bubble up.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of potential offenses/slashings:\r\n1. Creating duplicate side-cars for a given slot/index. This is the most obvious anti-spam prevention and would lead to easy rules to follow and easy conditions to validate on-chain\r\n2. Creating invalid side-cars -- e.g. sidecars for indices beyond the amount of blobs in the block. This is a *much* more complex type of condition to encode in your anti-slashing DBs as well as to verify on chain.\r\n\r\nThe complexity and risks around (2) seem not a worthwhile path to go down.\r\n\r\nI am personally open to the discussion of (1), but by default, I am resistant to getting into VC anti-slashing DBs and coding this into the core consensus just due to the complexity, and as @dankrad noted, the additional risks it adds to running a validator and thus continue to disincentivize less professional players from validating.\r\n",

The default is to require optimal finalization (every 2 epochs).\r\n- `REORG_HEAD_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` is set to 20% (half of the proposer boost) so that an attacker must control up to `PROPOSER_BOOST_SCORE - REORG_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` = 20% of attester weight in order to perform an ex-ante reorg. The attack works by releasing attestations for the block at slot `N + 1` around the same time as the honest proposer publishes the attempted reorg block at `N + 2`. The late attestations tip the weight of the `N + 1` block from `< REORG_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` to `> PROPOSER_BOOST_SCORE`, meaning that block `N + 1` will be preferred to block `N + 2`.\r\n- `REORG_PARENT_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` is set to 160% so that an attacker that is hoarding attestations cannot cause the attempted re-org to fail. For details of this calculation see: https://ethresear.ch/t/selfish-mining-in-pos/15551.\r\n\r\nFor background on the development of this idea, see: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/2860.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n\r\n- Completely optional for clients and node operators, can be switched on and off via a flag. Low risk.\r\n- Can be rolled out almost immediately unlike other late block mitigations which are still in R&D.\r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n\r\n- Considerable complexity, particularly regarding the overriding of fork choice updates for the canonical head.\r\n- Obsoleted by `(block, slot)` fork choice. If a viable implementation of `(block, slot)` fork choice emerges then reorging late blocks will become the default behaviour.\r\n- Relies on proposer boost, which may be phased out in favour of other fork choice changes (e.g. view-merge).\r\n\r\nThanks to @potuz @mkalinin @terencechain @fradamt @casparschwa @djrtwo for feedback on this idea.",

This could allow malicious peers to perform DOS attacks by referencing a very old parent block. Due to the requirements for nodes to verify proposer shuffling for these blobs, you could have a malicous peer force a honest node to perform an excessive amount of epoch transitions to verify the shuffling for the proposer. In order to mitigate this we can simply add the same gossip validation condition that we have for beacon blocks for blobs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[REJECT] The current finalized_checkpoint is an ancestor of block -- i.e. get_checkpoint_block(store, block.parent_root, store.finalized_checkpoint.epoch) == store.finalized_checkpoint.root\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was encountered when running an Antithesis experiment.",

                "body": "Specify a function in fork choice `get_proposer_head` which returns the parent block upon which a proposer may build while possibly reorging the canonical head (if it was broadcast late and lacks sufficient attestation weight).\r\n\r\nThe mechanism is designed with safeguards built in so that it does not cause liveness failures:\r\n\r\n- Only single-slot reorgs are attempted: block `N + 2` may build on block `N` if block `N + 1` arrived late.\r\n- Finalization must be occurring with the expected frequency determined by `REORG_MAX_EPOCHS_SINCE_FINALIZATION`. The default is to require optimal finalization (every 2 epochs).\r\n- `REORG_HEAD_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` is set to 20% (half of the proposer boost) so that an attacker must control up to `PROPOSER_BOOST_SCORE - REORG_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` = 20% of attester weight in order to perform an ex-ante reorg. The attack works by releasing attestations for the block at slot `N + 1` around the same time as the honest proposer publishes the attempted reorg block at `N + 2`. The late attestations tip the weight of the `N + 1` block from `< REORG_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` to `> PROPOSER_BOOST_SCORE`, meaning that block `N + 1` will be preferred to block `N + 2`.\r\n- `REORG_PARENT_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` is set to 160% so that an attacker that is hoarding attestations cannot cause the attempted re-org to fail. For details of this calculation see: https://ethresear.ch/t/selfish-mining-in-pos/15551.\r\n\r\nFor background on the development of this idea, see: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/2860.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n\r\n- Completely optional for clients and node operators, can be switched on and off via a flag. Low risk.\r\n- Can be rolled out almost immediately unlike other late block mitigations which are still in R&D.\r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n\r\n- Considerable complexity, particularly regarding the overriding of fork choice updates for the canonical head.\r\n- Obsoleted by `(block, slot)` fork choice. If a viable implementation of `(block, slot)` fork choice emerges then reorging late blocks will become the default behaviour.\r\n- Relies on proposer boost, which may be phased out in favour of other fork choice changes (e.g. view-merge).\r\n\r\nThanks to @potuz @mkalinin @terencechain @fradamt @casparschwa @djrtwo for feedback on this idea.",

                "body": "Specify a function in fork choice `get_proposer_head` which returns the parent block upon which a proposer may build while possibly reorging the canonical head (if it was broadcast late and lacks sufficient attestation weight).\r\n\r\nThe mechanism is designed with safeguards built in so that it does not cause liveness failures:\r\n\r\n- Only single-slot reorgs are attempted: block `N + 2` may build on block `N` if block `N + 1` arrived late.\r\n- Finalization must be occurring with the expected frequency determined by `REORG_MAX_EPOCHS_SINCE_FINALIZATION`. The default is to require optimal finalization (every 2 epochs).\r\n- `REORG_HEAD_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` is set to 20% (half of the proposer boost) so that an attacker must control up to `PROPOSER_BOOST_SCORE - REORG_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` = 20% of attester weight in order to perform an ex-ante reorg. The attack works by releasing attestations for the block at slot `N + 1` around the same time as the honest proposer publishes the attempted reorg block at `N + 2`. The late attestations tip the weight of the `N + 1` block from `< REORG_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` to `> PROPOSER_BOOST_SCORE`, meaning that block `N + 1` will be preferred to block `N + 2`.\r\n- `REORG_PARENT_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` is set to 160% so that an attacker that is hoarding attestations cannot cause the attempted re-org to fail. For details of this calculation see: https://ethresear.ch/t/selfish-mining-in-pos/15551.\r\n\r\nFor background on the development of this idea, see: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/2860.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n\r\n- Completely optional for clients and node operators, can be switched on and off via a flag. Low risk.\r\n- Can be rolled out almost immediately unlike other late block mitigations which are still in R&D.\r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n\r\n- Considerable complexity, particularly regarding the overriding of fork choice updates for the canonical head.\r\n- Obsoleted by `(block, slot)` fork choice. If a viable implementation of `(block, slot)` fork choice emerges then reorging late blocks will become the default behaviour.\r\n- Relies on proposer boost, which may be phased out in favour of other fork choice changes (e.g. view-merge).\r\n\r\nThanks to @potuz @mkalinin @terencechain @fradamt @casparschwa @djrtwo for feedback on this idea.",

The default is to require optimal finalization (every 2 epochs).\r\n- `REORG_HEAD_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` is set to 20% (half of the proposer boost) so that an attacker must control up to `PROPOSER_BOOST_SCORE - REORG_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` = 20% of attester weight in order to perform an ex-ante reorg. The attack works by releasing attestations for the block at slot `N + 1` around the same time as the honest proposer publishes the attempted reorg block at `N + 2`. The late attestations tip the weight of the `N + 1` block from `< REORG_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` to `> PROPOSER_BOOST_SCORE`, meaning that block `N + 1` will be preferred to block `N + 2`.\r\n- `REORG_PARENT_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` is set to 160% so that an attacker that is hoarding attestations cannot cause the attempted re-org to fail. For details of this calculation see: https://ethresear.ch/t/selfish-mining-in-pos/15551.\r\n\r\nFor background on the development of this idea, see: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/2860.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n\r\n- Completely optional for clients and node operators, can be switched on and off via a flag. Low risk.\r\n- Can be rolled out almost immediately unlike other late block mitigations which are still in R&D.\r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n\r\n- Considerable complexity, particularly regarding the overriding of fork choice updates for the canonical head.\r\n- Obsoleted by `(block, slot)` fork choice. If a viable implementation of `(block, slot)` fork choice emerges then reorging late blocks will become the default behaviour.\r\n- Relies on proposer boost, which may be phased out in favour of other fork choice changes (e.g. view-merge).\r\n\r\nThanks to @potuz @mkalinin @terencechain @fradamt @casparschwa @djrtwo for feedback on this idea.",

                "body": "Specify a function in fork choice `get_proposer_head` which returns the parent block upon which a proposer may build while possibly reorging the canonical head (if it was broadcast late and lacks sufficient attestation weight).\r\n\r\nThe mechanism is designed with safeguards built in so that it does not cause liveness failures:\r\n\r\n- Only single-slot reorgs are attempted: block `N + 2` may build on block `N` if block `N + 1` arrived late.\r\n- Finalization must be occurring with the expected frequency determined by `REORG_MAX_EPOCHS_SINCE_FINALIZATION`. The default is to require optimal finalization (every 2 epochs).\r\n- `REORG_HEAD_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` is set to 20% (half of the proposer boost) so that an attacker must control up to `PROPOSER_BOOST_SCORE - REORG_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` = 20% of attester weight in order to perform an ex-ante reorg. The attack works by releasing attestations for the block at slot `N + 1` around the same time as the honest proposer publishes the attempted reorg block at `N + 2`. The late attestations tip the weight of the `N + 1` block from `< REORG_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` to `> PROPOSER_BOOST_SCORE`, meaning that block `N + 1` will be preferred to block `N + 2`.\r\n- `REORG_PARENT_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD` is set to 160% so that an attacker that is hoarding attestations cannot cause the attempted re-org to fail. For details of this calculation see: https://ethresear.ch/t/selfish-mining-in-pos/15551.\r\n\r\nFor background on the development of this idea, see: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/2860.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n\r\n- Completely optional for clients and node operators, can be switched on and off via a flag. Low risk.\r\n- Can be rolled out almost immediately unlike other late block mitigations which are still in R&D.\r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n\r\n- Considerable complexity, particularly regarding the overriding of fork choice updates for the canonical head.\r\n- Obsoleted by `(block, slot)` fork choice. If a viable implementation of `(block, slot)` fork choice emerges then reorging late blocks will become the default behaviour.\r\n- Relies on proposer boost, which may be phased out in favour of other fork choice changes (e.g. view-merge).\r\n\r\nThanks to @potuz @mkalinin @terencechain @fradamt @casparschwa @djrtwo for feedback on this idea.",
