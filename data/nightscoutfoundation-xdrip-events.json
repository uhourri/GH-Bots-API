The result is this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28660369/88337717-74852680-cd37-11ea-982d-08e5b1b87a11.png\" data-canonical-src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28660369/88337717-74852680-cd37-11ea-982d-08e5b1b87a11.png\" width=\"200\"/>\r\n\r\nThese additions should hopefully make it much easier for users to create profiles that correlate better to their insulin needs, by both making MDI easier to configure and BG predictions more accurate.\r\n",

I have seen this on several Samsung phones as well as phones like the Pixel 3a (controlled under Lockscreen settings)\r\n\r\nIf your phone has the ability to display, for example, a clock even when it is locked and the screen is \"off\" and not just during charging then you may be able to make use of this feature. Check your Android settings for `AOD`, `Always On Display` or `Lockscreen settings` that allow a clock to be displayed always.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to help me with the testing of this, please comment on this issue with:\r\n\r\n1) The Make and Model of your phone, eg Samsung S9\r\n2) Android version in use, eg 8/9/10/11 etc\r\n\r\nI'll follow up with more instructions on how to activate the feature as soon as it is ready for testing. It looks roughly as shown in the photo below:\r\n\r\n![xdrip-aod-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12565568/106205149-ee4e0f00-61b5-11eb-9f4e-c8f04e30c07c.jpg)\r\n\r\n",

After they post in a forum and ask, they are told that they cannot just restart a G6 sensor as they could with other sensors.  \r\n<br/>  \r\n  \r\nIs there a way to add a conditional to an xml file so that I don't have to create a new xml file as I have done here?",

I have seen this on several Samsung phones as well as phones like the Pixel 3a (controlled under Lockscreen settings)\r\n\r\nIf your phone has the ability to display, for example, a clock even when it is locked and the screen is \"off\" and not just during charging then you may be able to make use of this feature. Check your Android settings for `AOD`, `Always On Display` or `Lockscreen settings` that allow a clock to be displayed always.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to help me with the testing of this, please comment on this issue with:\r\n\r\n1) The Make and Model of your phone, eg Samsung S9\r\n2) Android version in use, eg 8/9/10/11 etc\r\n\r\nI'll follow up with more instructions on how to activate the feature as soon as it is ready for testing. It looks roughly as shown in the photo below:\r\n\r\n![xdrip-aod-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12565568/106205149-ee4e0f00-61b5-11eb-9f4e-c8f04e30c07c.jpg)\r\n\r\n",

I have seen this on several Samsung phones as well as phones like the Pixel 3a (controlled under Lockscreen settings)\r\n\r\nIf your phone has the ability to display, for example, a clock even when it is locked and the screen is \"off\" and not just during charging then you may be able to make use of this feature. Check your Android settings for `AOD`, `Always On Display` or `Lockscreen settings` that allow a clock to be displayed always.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to help me with the testing of this, please comment on this issue with:\r\n\r\n1) The Make and Model of your phone, eg Samsung S9\r\n2) Android version in use, eg 8/9/10/11 etc\r\n\r\nI'll follow up with more instructions on how to activate the feature as soon as it is ready for testing. It looks roughly as shown in the photo below:\r\n\r\n![xdrip-aod-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12565568/106205149-ee4e0f00-61b5-11eb-9f4e-c8f04e30c07c.jpg)\r\n\r\n",

I have seen this on several Samsung phones as well as phones like the Pixel 3a (controlled under Lockscreen settings)\r\n\r\nIf your phone has the ability to display, for example, a clock even when it is locked and the screen is \"off\" and not just during charging then you may be able to make use of this feature. Check your Android settings for `AOD`, `Always On Display` or `Lockscreen settings` that allow a clock to be displayed always.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to help me with the testing of this, please comment on this issue with:\r\n\r\n1) The Make and Model of your phone, eg Samsung S9\r\n2) Android version in use, eg 8/9/10/11 etc\r\n\r\nI'll follow up with more instructions on how to activate the feature as soon as it is ready for testing. It looks roughly as shown in the photo below:\r\n\r\n![xdrip-aod-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12565568/106205149-ee4e0f00-61b5-11eb-9f4e-c8f04e30c07c.jpg)\r\n\r\n",
