In 3.7.17 we are still experiencing https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/10737, where we have the same setup with `cache-and-network` being the default fetchPolicy. In our case it also happens that we run a query with `cache-and-network`, then due to the `nextFetchPolicy` function that we implement, we set the next fetch policy to `cache-first` (similar to how it is mentioned [in the docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries/#nextfetchpolicy)). Now while the first query is still running and the cached result is returned, we get back the loading state being false.\r\n\r\nThis caused us to implement some workarounds, that we also need to think of whenever we add new queries. In the linked issue, there is a [comment](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/10737#issuecomment-1674078345) saying that this issue got inadvertently fixed in 3.8.x.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have found that since 3.8.5, it happens again. Using the original code sandbox from the issue, I can see that [it works with 3.8.4](https://codesandbox.io/s/loading-false-while-fetching-forked-hrdqxh?file=/src/index.jsx) but [doesn't work with 3.8.5](https://codesandbox.io/s/loading-false-while-fetching-forked-45yqz8?file=/src/index.jsx).\n\n### Link to Reproduction\n\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/loading-false-while-fetching-forked-45yqz8?file=/src/index.jsx\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\nSee the reproduction link above.

A small sampling:\r\n\r\n- https://zendesk.github.io/laika/\r\n- https://github.com/mike-gibson/mock-apollo-client\r\n- https://www.arahansen.com/testing-apollo-components-using-react-testing-library/\r\n- https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-apollo-client-testing/\r\n- https://medium.com/free-code-camp/a-new-approach-to-mocking-graphql-data-1ef49de3d491\r\n\r\nTo make sure Apollo Client is giving developers the tools they need to develop robust and effective client applications out of the box, we're working on a new testing approach that will become part of the core library.\r\n\r\nWe'll share more details about these plans shortly, but would love to hear from the community regarding their biggest complaints about Apollo Client's existing testing functionality, what people would like to see fixed or handled differently, and hear about recommendations of community approaches you prefer.",

They are mostly ports of counterpart Relay's functionality and similarly as mentioned before in this thread, we find such API more convenient to use than mocked provider, as you only need to think about mocking per type level. Great thing is that these tools can be very nicely used both in unit tests and in Storybook, which we also added more details on in [another testing tools package we own](https://github.com/microsoft/nova-facade/blob/main/packages/nova-react-test-utils/README.md). I would be happy to share more details in case anyone is interested",

I would expect the error from the server to be surfaced from `useLazyQuery`. \r\n\r\nI am using \r\nnode 20\r\n\"@apollo/client\": \"^3.8.4\",\r\n\n\n### Link to Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/stretch0/apollo-client-native-sandbox\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\nSetup app\r\n\r\nUsing node v20\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm run android\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce app loads, click the `PRESS ME` button.\r\n\r\nNote Apollo Client throws an error complaining it can't read property `data` of undefined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/assets/66245546/dc1abe17-0c95-4514-9b80-b22ef1106554\r\n\r\nI have also tested this same query using the `useQuery` hook and it just seems to show `loading: true` the whole time, rather than returning an error. I would expect an error to be returned form the `useQuery` hook. \r\n\r\nAny help in understanding this issue with surfacing the correct error would be greatly appreciated. Thanks",

                "body": "Thanks for the nudge @kekami!  I do have some updates for you and @FOODy:\r\n\r\n@FOODy's understanding of the expected behavior of `read` is correct.  This was indeed a bug and was resolved by https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/11202, which is available as of `3.9.0-alpha.0` - you can try it out via `npm i @apollo/client@next`.  You'll notice, however, that the linked reproduction still has some bugs after upgrading to the latest 3.9 Alpha version.  This is due to the usage of `writeQuery` here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/FOODy/apollo-client-cache-typepolicy-read-multiple-call-bug/blob/067a1ac5094a5d97680b14009ce4f5b29213331d/src/index.jsx#L44-L53\r\n\r\nNotice that we're accumulating `\"+\"` due to reading the field and then writing the `\"+\"` directly into the cache.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense?  Try upgrading and let us know whether it resolves the issue in your app.  Let me know if you have any more questions!",

Therefore, I consider switching to apollo client as my state manager for its built-in caching mechanism.\r\n\r\nI'm using codegen to generate hooks to interact with my graphql server, here is an example\r\n```ts\r\nconst [createProductMutation, { data, loading, error }] = useCreateOneProductMutation({\r\n    // options here\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to the documentation I can update the cache by providing the update function to my mutation call, and the hook that I generated also accepts the update method as an option..\r\n```ts\r\nconst GET_TODOS = gql`\r\n  query GetTodos {\r\n    todos {\r\n      id\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n`;\r\n\r\nconst [addTodo] = useMutation(ADD_TODO, {\r\n    update(cache, { data: { addTodo } }) {\r\n      cache.modify({\r\n        fields: {\r\n          todos(existingTodos = []) {\r\n            const newTodoRef = cache.writeFragment({\r\n              data: addTodo,\r\n              fragment: gql`\r\n                fragment NewTodo on Todo {\r\n                  id\r\n                  type\r\n                }\r\n              `\r\n            });\r\n            return [...existingTodos, newTodoRef];\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is an update method in the hook generated by codegen, but according to the docs I have to pass in query/fragment I would like to update, but I am storing my queries in a seperate folder in .graphql files and in graphql language. Any ideas on how I can pass the query without copy pasting it into the update method of the hook everytime?",

In that case, it would not write `obj` to the store and create a \"dead\" reference. I also added a DEV-level warning for those cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f  This PR uses #11177, so it should only be merged after that - but it can already be reviewed.",

In that case, it would not write `obj` to the store and create a \"dead\" reference. I also added a DEV-level warning for those cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f  This PR uses #11177, so it should only be merged after that - but it can already be reviewed.",

In that case, it would not write `obj` to the store and create a \"dead\" reference. I also added a DEV-level warning for those cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f  This PR uses #11177, so it should only be merged after that - but it can already be reviewed.",

In that case, it would not write `obj` to the store and create a \"dead\" reference. I also added a DEV-level warning for those cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f  This PR uses #11177, so it should only be merged after that - but it can already be reviewed.",

In that case, it would not write `obj` to the store and create a \"dead\" reference. I also added a DEV-level warning for those cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f  This PR uses #11177, so it should only be merged after that - but it can already be reviewed.",

In that case, it would not write `obj` to the store and create a \"dead\" reference. I also added a DEV-level warning for those cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f  This PR uses #11177, so it should only be merged after that - but it can already be reviewed.",

In that case, it would not write `obj` to the store and create a \"dead\" reference. I also added a DEV-level warning for those cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f  This PR uses #11177, so it should only be merged after that - but it can already be reviewed.",

In that case, it would not write `obj` to the store and create a \"dead\" reference. I also added a DEV-level warning for those cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f  This PR uses #11177, so it should only be merged after that - but it can already be reviewed.",

In that case, it would not write `obj` to the store and create a \"dead\" reference. I also added a DEV-level warning for those cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f  This PR uses #11177, so it should only be merged after that - but it can already be reviewed.",

In that case, it would not write `obj` to the store and create a \"dead\" reference. I also added a DEV-level warning for those cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f  This PR uses #11177, so it should only be merged after that - but it can already be reviewed.",

                "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nWhen using Graphql and Apollo Client in our project I came across an issue that is not resulting in an error and thus provides us with inconsistent data. I understood that this issue is created by us in the end, though I think that apollo client should provide us with an error in this case if it is possible.\r\n\r\nThere seems to a problem with data assigning in the apollo client because when I tested the query it is working in the playground and using a standard fetch request was also getting me the correct data.\r\n\r\nI am using Golang for the backend and an Angular app for the frontend. Both are using graphql codegen to generate the types and queries/mutations.\r\n\r\n`github.com/99designs/gqlgen`: `v0.17.22`\r\n\r\n`apollo-angular`: `^5.0.0`\r\n\r\n`graphql`: `^16.8.0`\r\n\r\n`@apollo/client`: `^3.7.15`\r\n\r\nI have also checked previous issues and they didnt seem to match my findings exactly: #9850 or #3234\r\n\r\n### Link to Reproduction\r\n\r\nNo specific link for reproduction\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\nI have a type setup that looks like this:\r\n\r\n```graphql\r\ntype TestCount {\r\n  testcase: Testcase!\r\n  testCount: Int!\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype Testcase {\r\n  id: ID!\r\n  name: String!\r\n  type: String!\r\n}\r\n\r\nextend type Query {\r\n  getTestCounts(): [TestCount!]!\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen doing the query in the play ground it would look like this:\r\n\r\n```graphql\r\nquery {\r\n  getTestCounts {\r\n    testcase {\r\n      id\r\n      name\r\n      type\r\n    }\r\n    testCount\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result would be similar to this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"getTestCounts\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"testcase\": {\r\n          \"id\": \"\",\r\n          \"name\": \"Testing for the bug\",\r\n          \"type\": \"Text\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"testCount\": 100\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"testcase\": {\r\n          \"id\": \"\",\r\n          \"name\": \"Different case\",\r\n          \"type\": \"Automated\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"testCount\": 123\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"testcase\": {\r\n          \"id\": \"\",\r\n          \"name\": \"A different kind of test\",\r\n          \"type\": \"Manual\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"testCount\": 251\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow to the problematic set up. I did the query in the backend where I made a object that would only include the necessary field I need to form a unique name `name` and `type`. Since I used the code generated DTOs I made a dto with just these two fields. \r\n\r\n```golang\r\nvar testcase = &dto.Testcase{\r\n  Name: tc.Name,\r\n  Type: tc.Type,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs one could see the query in the playground wants to get an ID as well which is a valid action to do so in the playground I get `ID` as an empty string, however when I make the same query with the Apollo client I get weird behaviour. The data in the network tab from the browser shows the correct data but if I log out the data from the result of the query I get different data.\r\n\r\nData from network tab:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"getTestCounts\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"testcase\": {\r\n          \"id\": \"\",\r\n          \"name\": \"Testing for the bug\",\r\n          \"type\": \"Text\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"testCount\": 100\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"testcase\": {\r\n          \"id\": \"\",\r\n          \"name\": \"Different case\",\r\n          \"type\": \"Automated\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"testCount\": 123\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"testcase\": {\r\n          \"id\": \"\",\r\n          \"name\": \"A different kind of test\",\r\n          \"type\": \"Manual\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"testCount\": 251\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nData from query:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"getTestCounts\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"testcase\": {\r\n          \"id\": \"\",\r\n          \"name\": \"Testing for the bug\",\r\n          \"type\": \"Text\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"testCount\": 100\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"testcase\": {\r\n          \"id\": \"\",\r\n          \"name\": \"Testing for the bug\",\r\n          \"type\": \"Text\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"testCount\": 123\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"testcase\": {\r\n          \"id\": \"\",\r\n          \"name\": \"Testing for the bug\",\r\n          \"type\": \"Text\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"testCount\": 251\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs one can see the data is not consistent with the data from the network tab. I think this is because the apollo client is using the `ID` to assign the data to the correct object. Since the `ID` is empty it is assigning the data to the first object it can find. But since I request the `ID` but not provide it from the backend side it is empty and techincally it is not an error since one can freely choose what to request with graphql. I feel like there should be an error at some point so this cannot happen, either when using the genreated code or when doing the query.\r\n\r\nMy solution is to just correctly provide the `ID` or do not request the `ID` at all.",

                "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nWhen using Graphql and Apollo Client in our project I came across an issue that is not resulting in an error and thus provides us with inconsistent data. I understood that this issue is created by us in the end, though I think that apollo client should provide us with an error in this case if it is possible.\r\n\r\nThere seems to a problem with data assigning in the apollo client because when I tested the query it is working in the playground and using a standard fetch request was also getting me the correct data.\r\n\r\nI am using Golang for the backend and an Angular app for the frontend. Both are using graphql codegen to generate the types and queries/mutations.\r\n\r\n`github.com/99designs/gqlgen`: `v0.17.22`\r\n\r\n`apollo-angular`: `^5.0.0`\r\n\r\n`graphql`: `^16.8.0`\r\n\r\n`@apollo/client`: `^3.7.15`\r\n\r\nI have also checked previous issues and they didnt seem to match my findings exactly: #9850 or #3234\r\n\r\n### Link to Reproduction\r\n\r\nNo specific link for reproduction\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\nI have a type setup that looks like this:\r\n\r\n```graphql\r\ntype TestCount {\r\n  testcase: Testcase!\r\n  testCount: Int!\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype Testcase {\r\n  id: ID!\r\n  name: String!\r\n  type: String!\r\n}\r\n\r\nextend type Query {\r\n  getTestCounts(): [TestCount!]!\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen doing the query in the play ground it would look like this:\r\n\r\n```graphql\r\nquery {\r\n  getTestCounts {\r\n    testcase {\r\n      id\r\n      name\r\n      type\r\n    }\r\n    testCount\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result would be similar to this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"getTestCounts\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"testcase\": {\r\n          \"id\": \"\",\r\n          \"name\": \"Testing for the bug\",\r\n          \"type\": \"Text\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"testCount\": 100\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"testcase\": {\r\n          \"id\": \"\",\r\n          \"name\": \"Different case\",\r\n          \"type\": \"Automated\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"testCount\": 123\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"testcase\": {\r\n          \"id\": \"\",\r\n          \"name\": \"A different kind of test\",\r\n          \"type\": \"Manual\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"testCount\": 251\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow to the problematic set up. I did the query in the backend where I made a object that would only include the necessary field I need to form a unique name `name` and `type`. Since I used the code generated DTOs I made a dto with just these two fields. \r\n\r\n```golang\r\nvar testcase = &dto.Testcase{\r\n  Name: tc.Name,\r\n  Type: tc.Type,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs one could see the query in the playground wants to get an ID as well which is a valid action to do so in the playground I get `ID` as an empty string, however when I make the same query with the Apollo client I get weird behaviour. The data in the network tab from the browser shows the correct data but if I log out the data from the result of the query I get different data.\r\n\r\nData from network tab:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"getTestCounts\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"testcase\": {\r\n          \"id\": \"\",\r\n          \"name\": \"Testing for the bug\",\r\n          \"type\": \"Text\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"testCount\": 100\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"testcase\": {\r\n          \"id\": \"\",\r\n          \"name\": \"Different case\",\r\n          \"type\": \"Automated\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"testCount\": 123\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"testcase\": {\r\n          \"id\": \"\",\r\n          \"name\": \"A different kind of test\",\r\n          \"type\": \"Manual\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"testCount\": 251\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nData from query:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"getTestCounts\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"testcase\": {\r\n          \"id\": \"\",\r\n          \"name\": \"Testing for the bug\",\r\n          \"type\": \"Text\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"testCount\": 100\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"testcase\": {\r\n          \"id\": \"\",\r\n          \"name\": \"Testing for the bug\",\r\n          \"type\": \"Text\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"testCount\": 123\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"testcase\": {\r\n          \"id\": \"\",\r\n          \"name\": \"Testing for the bug\",\r\n          \"type\": \"Text\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"testCount\": 251\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs one can see the data is not consistent with the data from the network tab. I think this is because the apollo client is using the `ID` to assign the data to the correct object. Since the `ID` is empty it is assigning the data to the first object it can find. But since I request the `ID` but not provide it from the backend side it is empty and techincally it is not an error since one can freely choose what to request with graphql. I feel like there should be an error at some point so this cannot happen, either when using the genreated code or when doing the query.\r\n\r\nMy solution is to just correctly provide the `ID` or do not request the `ID` at all.",
