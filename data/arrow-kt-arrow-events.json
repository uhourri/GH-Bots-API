                "body": "Arrow is migrating from the Kotest Multiplatform plugin to Kotlin-test,\r\nnot because we don't love Kotest but because Arrow wants to support experimental targets like wasm and be buildable and testable with Kotlin EAP & DEV version such that we can help the Kotlin team prevent regression. We're continue using Kotest property testing, and Kotest assertions.\r\n\r\nArrow needs the help of the community to do this, and the Arrow maintainers will be more than happy to help you through the progress.\r\n\r\nThis ticket requires following changes in `NonEmptySetTest.kt`. Here is a small list of things to do:\r\n\r\n 1. Fork & clone the Arrow repository\r\n 2. Checkout the `arrow-2` branch and create a new branch from it.\r\n 3. Replace all tests with shape `\"name of test {\"` to camelCase/dromedaryCase `@Test fun nameOfTest() = runTest {` in the test class\r\n 4. Remove `StringSpec` as the super class from the test class\r\n 5. Run `./gradlew spotlessApply`\r\n 6. Commit your changes, and push the new branch to your repo\r\n 7. Create a PR on the Arrow repository from your branch targetting `arrow-2`.\r\n\r\nArrow really appreciates all the help, and looks forward to a bright future together in Kotlin :party:\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!",

The implementation also gets the iterator of the iterable more than once. See #3123 .\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the implementation of both to correctly handle the nullable case, as well as ensuring the iterable is only iterated once. The overload of the latter function with `Set<A>` as the receiver is also removed, as there is no difference in behaviour or functionality between it and the `Iterable` overload (and of course a set is iterable).",
