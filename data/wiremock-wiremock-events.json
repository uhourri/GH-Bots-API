It looks like Wiremock adds ~ 28 bytes to the header on decoding/encoding image/h264 while proxying. No transformations are done during this request.\r\n \r\n **Steps to reproduce:**\r\n- Send any request with `\"accept-encoding\" : \"gzip\"` and  default `gzipDisabled` option (which is set to `false` i.e gzip encoding/decoding is enabled by default) to the server which should return any media file encoded in h/264 ByteStream through the Wiremock proxy requests option;\r\n- Verify ByteStream length and \"Content-Lenght\" header values. They should be the same.\r\nIn our case app receives \r\n`Failure OtherException(throwable=java.io.IOException: Content-Length (23612) and stream length (23584) disagree)`\r\n_Note:_ Our case passes when we set `gzipDisabled` to true. This is not the issue solver as we do need gzip encoding/decoding on some requests.",

So, it does return results and quickly. I can't see a way to solve this where we don't add a retry at some level.\r\n    \r\nThe way you were describing CompletableFuture, I thought there was a method that you could tell it what result you want from the Task and it would maybe auto retry it for you until it returned what you were looking for or timedout.",
