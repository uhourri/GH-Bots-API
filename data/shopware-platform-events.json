When we have uuidv7 it should even be the first one to be indexed be the \"Rebuild search index\" step.\r\n\r\nIf you now rebuild search index and close the browser window you get the info of the current date time of the last indexing and still most of the products can't be found using the search because the search is not ready.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"986\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/shopware/shopware/assets/1133593/ebc3f5c1-76c7-4d5f-86fb-28fab7e30722\">\r\n\r\n### 2. What does this change do, exactly?\r\n\r\nUse an aggregation of min and max createdAt instead of choosing the first indexing item's createdAt and using sw-time-ago for a human readable rendering\r\n\r\n<img width=\"984\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/shopware/shopware/assets/1133593/158b588f-4141-4269-beaa-a12aabb77490\">\r\n\r\nAt least you now know you need a full indexing after you changed settings.\r\n\r\n### 3. Describe each step to reproduce the issue or behaviour.\r\n\r\nAbort indexing or just have a product update of the \"first\" product and immediately the info is a lie.\r\n\r\n### 4.

Why is this change necessary?\r\nIf the dev server for administration is started in a container, the suitable host and port must be specified for SOCKS, otherwise it tries to query `devServer.host`.\r\n\r\n### 2. What does this change do, exactly?\r\nYou can now specify a SOCKS host and port. \r\nJust set `SOCKHOST` and/or `SOCKPORT`\r\n\r\n### 3. Describe each step to reproduce the issue or behaviour.\r\nIf the dev server for administration is started in a container, the socks connection tries to connect to `devServer.host` which in this case is 0.0.0.0:443, that doesn't work because my container is only available over a dev domain.\r\n\r\n### 4.

Please fill out this description template to help us to process your pull request.\r\n\r\nPlease make sure to fulfil our contribution guideline (https://developer.shopware.com/docs/resources/guidelines/code/contribution?category=shopware-platform-dev-en/contribution).\r\n\r\nDo your changes need to be mentioned in the documentation?\r\nPlease create a second pull request at https://github.com/shopware/docs\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### 1. Why is this change necessary?\r\nIf the dev server for administration is started in a container, the suitable host and port must be specified for SOCKS, otherwise it tries to query `devServer.host`.\r\n\r\n### 2. What does this change do, exactly?\r\nYou can now specify a SOCKS host and port. \r\nJust set `SOCKHOST` and/or `SOCKPORT`\r\n\r\n### 3. Describe each step to reproduce the issue or behaviour.\r\nIf the dev server for administration is started in a container, the socks connection tries to connect to `devServer.host` which in this case is 0.0.0.0:443, that doesn't work because my container is only available over a dev domain.\r\n\r\n### 4. Please link to the relevant issues (if any).\r\n\r\n\r\n### 5.
