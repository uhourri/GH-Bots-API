                "body": "Thank you for the answer, @Lawrence37!\r\n\r\nRegarding the zoom, yes it's not really unlimited. It's limited with the default max zoom, which is 1600%. I guess it would be better to add all the possible options, like 100%, 200%, 400%, 800%, 1600% and leave it as a combo box.\r\n\r\nRegarging the translations, I understood. Is there a document where I may see more details about the contribution? I still have a couple of questions there. For example, if I know a language, may I correct/add translations myself? (I see some translations are absent)\r\n",

I'd like to post a feature request.\n\n\nThe idea is to support the WarpRectilinear opcode that some DNG files have. The opcode\nspecifies how the lens distortion should be corrected when demosaicing the DNG file.\nCode for reading the opcode and correcting the distortion is available from Adobe as\npart of the open source DNG SDK, in the utility dng_validate. Currently RT ignores\nthe opcode and therefore DNG files that contain it are uncorrected for distortion.\n\nThe ZIP file linked below includes the following files:\n1_P7183225.ORF - Original RAW file in ORF format (taken with an Olympus E-M10 camera)\n2_P7183225_OOC.jpg - Out of camera jpeg (downsized to 1MP)\n3_P7183225.dng - DNG 1.4 file created with Adobe DNG Converter\n4_P7183225_RT.jpg - Output of DNG file when converted to JPG in RT\n5_P7183225_DNG_VALIDATE.tif - Output of DNG file when converted to TIFF using dng_validate.\n\nZIP (35MB):\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21642925/RT_DNG_OPCODE.ZIP\n\nAs you can see, the out of camera jpeg and the file created by dng_validate are both\ncorrected for distortion, while the file created by RT is not. \n\nI tried to work with the DNG SDK in the past but it's a nightmare to get it to compile.\nI didn't manage to build dng_validate locally. I'm also not familiar enough with RT's\ncode to implement such a feature by myself currently. I hope that this can be implemented\nsometime in the future.\n\nThank you,\nAssaf\n```\n\nReported by `assaft` on 2015-07-26 20:03:33\n",

Except for image related custom widgets (ex: thumbnail, image area, ...), all the RT GUI has been migrated to handle Hi-DPI.\r\n\r\nExample 1:\r\n- Before (RT 5.9):\r\n![image](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/assets/40305292/1953de1e-8507-4a4c-b598-0df596728203)\r\n- After (this PR):\r\n![image](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/assets/40305292/e8aa9910-82d1-47f1-a16b-6dccd36a9aa9)\r\n\r\nExample 2:\r\n- Before (RT 5.9):\r\n![image](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/assets/40305292/001f6765-f21e-464b-8d34-20f84c00970b)\r\n- After (this PR):\r\n![image](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/assets/40305292/0efcdc9e-3ba8-4707-b6ff-2898ad45546c)\r\n\r\nThis PR has been tested with the following environnements:\r\n- Windows 11, 2K screen\r\n- MacOS Ventura, MacBook Retina screen\r\n- Debian Testing (VM), MacBook Retina screen\r\n\r\nIn a second PR, I will work on the image related custom widgets.\r\n\r\nDetailed list of changes:\r\n- Icons are now managed as Gtk Icon Theme. Surfaces are directly generated from .svg files and takes into account the DPI of the screen to avoid \"blur\" effect. To avoid reaching GDI limit on Windows, surfaces are buffered and reused (I hope it is handled differently in Gtk4...). Large parts of GUI code have been updated.\r\n- Custom widget `on_draw` functions have been updated to handle Hi-DPI during drawing.\r\n- Bug fix with Histogram panel widget: When loading an image, raw histogram data were incorectly not set (but provided)\r\n- Bug fix with Histogram panel widget: Fixes incorrect curve scaling in raw histogram mode (was incorrectly scaled using luma and chroma data)\r\n- Bug fix loading icon cache data: With some versions of Glib/Glibmm library on MacOS, Glib::KeyFile \"load_from_file\" function does not raise a Glib::Error but another exception. This causes cached data not saved on disk (and thumbnails not displayed in explorer). Adds robustness testing if file is present first before calling the function\r\n- Bug fix loading dynamic profiles data: Same issue with Glib::KeyFile \"load_from_file\" funtion\r\n- Cleanup of RT theme management\r\n- Simplification of font size management as Pango/Gtk directly manage pt/px conversion based on screen DPI\r\n- Bug fix in Preference panel: If panel is closed with \"cancel\" button, font size was not reinitialized to previously saved one\r\n- Bug fix in `RawTherapee.css` theme: Font size was sprecified in css file and so user choice could be ignored",

Except for image related custom widgets (ex: thumbnail, image area, ...), all the RT GUI has been migrated to handle Hi-DPI.\r\n\r\nExample 1:\r\n- Before (RT 5.9):\r\n![image](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/assets/40305292/1953de1e-8507-4a4c-b598-0df596728203)\r\n- After (this PR):\r\n![image](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/assets/40305292/e8aa9910-82d1-47f1-a16b-6dccd36a9aa9)\r\n\r\nExample 2:\r\n- Before (RT 5.9):\r\n![image](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/assets/40305292/001f6765-f21e-464b-8d34-20f84c00970b)\r\n- After (this PR):\r\n![image](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/assets/40305292/0efcdc9e-3ba8-4707-b6ff-2898ad45546c)\r\n\r\nThis PR has been tested with the following environnements:\r\n- Windows 11, 2K screen\r\n- MacOS Ventura, MacBook Retina screen\r\n- Debian Testing (VM), MacBook Retina screen\r\n\r\nIn a second PR, I will work on the image related custom widgets.\r\n\r\nDetailed list of changes:\r\n- Icons are now managed as Gtk Icon Theme. Surfaces are directly generated from .svg files and takes into account the DPI of the screen to avoid \"blur\" effect. To avoid reaching GDI limit on Windows, surfaces are buffered and reused (I hope it is handled differently in Gtk4...). Large parts of GUI code have been updated.\r\n- Custom widget `on_draw` functions have been updated to handle Hi-DPI during drawing.\r\n- Bug fix with Histogram panel widget: When loading an image, raw histogram data were incorectly not set (but provided)\r\n- Bug fix with Histogram panel widget: Fixes incorrect curve scaling in raw histogram mode (was incorrectly scaled using luma and chroma data)\r\n- Bug fix loading icon cache data: With some versions of Glib/Glibmm library on MacOS, Glib::KeyFile \"load_from_file\" function does not raise a Glib::Error but another exception. This causes cached data not saved on disk (and thumbnails not displayed in explorer). Adds robustness testing if file is present first before calling the function\r\n- Bug fix loading dynamic profiles data: Same issue with Glib::KeyFile \"load_from_file\" funtion\r\n- Cleanup of RT theme management\r\n- Simplification of font size management as Pango/Gtk directly manage pt/px conversion based on screen DPI\r\n- Bug fix in Preference panel: If panel is closed with \"cancel\" button, font size was not reinitialized to previously saved one\r\n- Bug fix in `RawTherapee.css` theme: Font size was sprecified in css file and so user choice could be ignored",

Except for image related custom widgets (ex: thumbnail, image area, ...), all the RT GUI has been migrated to handle Hi-DPI.\r\n\r\nExample 1:\r\n- Before (RT 5.9):\r\n![image](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/assets/40305292/1953de1e-8507-4a4c-b598-0df596728203)\r\n- After (this PR):\r\n![image](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/assets/40305292/e8aa9910-82d1-47f1-a16b-6dccd36a9aa9)\r\n\r\nExample 2:\r\n- Before (RT 5.9):\r\n![image](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/assets/40305292/001f6765-f21e-464b-8d34-20f84c00970b)\r\n- After (this PR):\r\n![image](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/assets/40305292/0efcdc9e-3ba8-4707-b6ff-2898ad45546c)\r\n\r\nThis PR has been tested with the following environnements:\r\n- Windows 11, 2K screen\r\n- MacOS Ventura, MacBook Retina screen\r\n- Debian Testing (VM), MacBook Retina screen\r\n\r\nIn a second PR, I will work on the image related custom widgets.\r\n\r\nDetailed list of changes:\r\n- Icons are now managed as Gtk Icon Theme. Surfaces are directly generated from .svg files and takes into account the DPI of the screen to avoid \"blur\" effect. To avoid reaching GDI limit on Windows, surfaces are buffered and reused (I hope it is handled differently in Gtk4...). Large parts of GUI code have been updated.\r\n- Custom widget `on_draw` functions have been updated to handle Hi-DPI during drawing.\r\n- Bug fix with Histogram panel widget: When loading an image, raw histogram data were incorectly not set (but provided)\r\n- Bug fix with Histogram panel widget: Fixes incorrect curve scaling in raw histogram mode (was incorrectly scaled using luma and chroma data)\r\n- Bug fix loading icon cache data: With some versions of Glib/Glibmm library on MacOS, Glib::KeyFile \"load_from_file\" function does not raise a Glib::Error but another exception. This causes cached data not saved on disk (and thumbnails not displayed in explorer). Adds robustness testing if file is present first before calling the function\r\n- Bug fix loading dynamic profiles data: Same issue with Glib::KeyFile \"load_from_file\" funtion\r\n- Cleanup of RT theme management\r\n- Simplification of font size management as Pango/Gtk directly manage pt/px conversion based on screen DPI\r\n- Bug fix in Preference panel: If panel is closed with \"cancel\" button, font size was not reinitialized to previously saved one\r\n- Bug fix in `RawTherapee.css` theme: Font size was sprecified in css file and so user choice could be ignored",

Except for image related custom widgets (ex: thumbnail, image area, ...), all the RT GUI has been migrated to handle Hi-DPI.\r\n\r\nExample 1:\r\n- Before (RT 5.9):\r\n![image](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/assets/40305292/1953de1e-8507-4a4c-b598-0df596728203)\r\n- After (this PR):\r\n![image](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/assets/40305292/e8aa9910-82d1-47f1-a16b-6dccd36a9aa9)\r\n\r\nExample 2:\r\n- Before (RT 5.9):\r\n![image](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/assets/40305292/001f6765-f21e-464b-8d34-20f84c00970b)\r\n- After (this PR):\r\n![image](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/assets/40305292/0efcdc9e-3ba8-4707-b6ff-2898ad45546c)\r\n\r\nThis PR has been tested with the following environnements:\r\n- Windows 11, 2K screen\r\n- MacOS Ventura, MacBook Retina screen\r\n- Debian Testing (VM), MacBook Retina screen\r\n\r\nIn a second PR, I will work on the image related custom widgets.\r\n\r\nDetailed list of changes:\r\n- Icons are now managed as Gtk Icon Theme. Surfaces are directly generated from .svg files and takes into account the DPI of the screen to avoid \"blur\" effect. To avoid reaching GDI limit on Windows, surfaces are buffered and reused (I hope it is handled differently in Gtk4...). Large parts of GUI code have been updated.\r\n- Custom widget `on_draw` functions have been updated to handle Hi-DPI during drawing.\r\n- Bug fix with Histogram panel widget: When loading an image, raw histogram data were incorectly not set (but provided)\r\n- Bug fix with Histogram panel widget: Fixes incorrect curve scaling in raw histogram mode (was incorrectly scaled using luma and chroma data)\r\n- Bug fix loading icon cache data: With some versions of Glib/Glibmm library on MacOS, Glib::KeyFile \"load_from_file\" function does not raise a Glib::Error but another exception. This causes cached data not saved on disk (and thumbnails not displayed in explorer). Adds robustness testing if file is present first before calling the function\r\n- Bug fix loading dynamic profiles data: Same issue with Glib::KeyFile \"load_from_file\" funtion\r\n- Cleanup of RT theme management\r\n- Simplification of font size management as Pango/Gtk directly manage pt/px conversion based on screen DPI\r\n- Bug fix in Preference panel: If panel is closed with \"cancel\" button, font size was not reinitialized to previously saved one\r\n- Bug fix in `RawTherapee.css` theme: Font size was sprecified in css file and so user choice could be ignored",

Activate `Batch Edit` tab and set `Whitebalance` to `Temperature correlation` (note thumbnail colours)\r\n3. Click `Put to queue` icon\r\n4. Open the same file in Editor\r\n5. `Put to queue` or `Save Current Image`\r\n6. Compare the two images and note very different WB. Often the image is completely pink or otherwise off sometimes it's less noticeable.\r\n\r\nAlternatively have a dynamic profile set the wb to Temperature correlation and export from File Browser.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nImages exported from File Browser should look like those exported from the Editor when no changes have been made. This should be the case even when the file hasn't been opened in the editor tab. \r\n\r\nA file with a dynamic profile set to use Temperature Correlation or the same set from batch mode should export a file where the full Temperature Correlation has been applied regardless of whether the file has been opened in the Editor.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n```\r\nVersion: 5.9-452-g88b0a5e45\r\nBranch: 5.10\r\nCommit: 88b0a5e45\r\nCommit date: 2023-10-12\r\nCompiler: cc 13.2.0\r\nProcessor: x86_64\r\nSystem: Linux\r\nBit depth: 64 bits\r\nGtkmm: V3.24.8\r\nLensfun: V0.3.4.0\r\nBuild type: release\r\nBuild flags: -std=c++11 -Wno-deprecated-declarations -Wno-unused-result -O3 -msse2 -std=c++11 -ffp-contract=off -march=native -Werror=unused-label -Werror=delete-incomplete -fno-math-errno -Wno-attributes -flto -Wall -Wuninitialized -Wcast-qual -Wno-deprecated-declarations -Wno-unused-result -Wunused-macros -fopenmp -Werror=unknown-pragmas -O3 -DNDEBUG -ftree-vectorize\r\nLink flags:  -march=native -flto\r\nOpenMP support: ON\r\nMMAP support: ON\r\nBuild OS: Linux 6.3.0-1-amd64 x86_64\r\nBuild date: Tue, 17 Oct 2023 17:06:06 +0000 UTC\r\nBuild epoch: 1697562366\r\nBuild UUID:\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nOther useful information:\r\nIt seems as if  ITCWB isn't initialized until the file is opened in the editor. Only some first step of setting a really off WB happens. The main issue with this that dynamic profiles become less useful. You have to \"fully\" edit all images and can't do quick exports with personal profiles.\r\n",
