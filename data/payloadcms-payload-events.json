I first noticed this error after clearing my pnpm cache and reinstalling all modules. The error is thrown when I open my NextJS frontend (live-preview and draft preview is not affected). The error is thrown in the traverseFields file from the live-preview package\r\n`traverseFields.js:15 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'forEach')\r\n    at traverseFields (traverseFields.js:15:1)\r\n    at mergeData (mergeData.js:17:1)\r\n    at handleMessage (handleMessage.js:29:1)\r\n    at onMessage (subscribe.js:17:1)`\r\nAfter some digging in the source code I have noticed that this happens because fieldSchema is undefined and forEach is called anyway. I was able to fix this locally by catching the undefined case `fieldSchema?.forEach(...)` in [line 24](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/main/packages/live-preview/src/traverseFields.ts) but I also thought that this code should not be called in the first place so there might be a bug in the conditions in the [handleMessage](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/main/packages/live-preview/src/handleMessage.ts) file which is calling the traverseFields eventually. This is only my assumption I hope it helps in fixing this issue.\r\n\r\nEDIT: \r\nI also found out that a similar problem occurs if you got for example the [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=de) browser extension activated on Chromium. There is a runtime error happening in handleMessage file of the same package because it also makes use of a MessageEvent. The error occurs when trying to JSON.parse the data field of the MessageEvent.\r\n<img width=\"246\" alt=\"Bildschirmfoto 2023-10-24 um 17 23 53\" src=\"https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/assets/60718229/b30f81d2-45d2-473b-9bc6-280e519bb700\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\nReally not sure how to reproduce this behaviour. Because it only happened after reinstalling my node_modules. I tried to use a fresh mongoDB table to make sure it wasn't my data causing this. I am using webpack, lexical, mongodb, NextJS custom server, drafts and live-preview. Sorry for the lack of information on the reproduction I hope pointing out the files from the source code helped.\r\n\r\n### Payload Version\r\n\r\n2.0.11 and 1.0.5 for live-preview-react\r\n\r\n### Adapters and Plugins\r\n\r\n_No response_",

I have some fields (slugs to generate URLs) that I need to be unique across a collection, and while this works, the UX in the admin panel is lacking. \r\n\r\nIn the console I get the error `ERROR (payload): error: duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"slug_idx\"`, but in the Admin UI all you get is a red error bar at the bottom that just says \"Something went wrong\", and the unique field that is the culprit is not highlighted. It is very confusing for a end user receiving this error, not knowing why their document failed to submit or what field to fix. \r\n\r\n\"Sounds like a bug with the Postgres adapter\" according to Elliot on Discord.\r\n\r\nSlghtly unrelated, but an idea I had for slightly improved UX: designate unique field with an indicator similar to the red asterisk for required fields, so end users know that a field needs to be unique in relation to other documents in the collection while they are working on creating the data for the document. A little heads-up, maybe minimizing errors in the editing experience?\n\n### To Reproduce\n\n1. Create a Collection\r\n2. Add a text field with `unique: true`\r\n3. Create a Document in the Collection\r\n4. Enter the value 'Test' in the text field with `unique: true`\r\n5. Save the Document\r\n6. Create a new Document\r\n7. Enter the value 'Test' in the field with `unique: true` in the new Document\r\n8. Save the new Document\n\n### Payload Version\n\n2.0.5\n\n### Adapters and Plugins\n\ndb-postgres ^0.1.4, bundler-webpack \"latest\"",
