Before, if (say) 10 threads called\n<code>cpu_percent(interval=None)</code> at the same time, only 1 thread out of 10\nwould get the right result.</li>\n<li>2266_: if <code>Process</code>_ class is passed a very high PID, raise <code>NoSuchProcess</code>_\ninstead of OverflowError.  (patch by Xuehai Pan)</li>\n<li>2246_: drop python 3.4 &amp; 3.5 support.  (patch by Matthieu Darbois)</li>\n<li>2290_: PID reuse is now pre-emptively checked for <code>Process.ppid()</code>_  and\n<code>Process.parents()</code>_.</li>\n<li>2312_: use <code>ruff</code> Python linter instead of <code>flake8 + isort</code>. It's an\norder of magnitude faster + it adds a ton of new code quality checks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>2195_, [Linux]: no longer print exception at import time in case /proc/stat\ncan't be read due to permission error. Redirect it to <code>PSUTIL_DEBUG</code>\ninstead.</li>\n<li>2241_, [NetBSD]: can't compile On NetBSD 10.99.3/amd64.  (patch by Thomas\nKlausner)</li>\n<li>2245_, [Windows]: fix var unbound error on possibly in <code>swap_memory()</code>_\n(patch by student_2333)</li>\n<li>2268_: <code>bytes2human()</code> utility function was unable to properly represent\nnegative values.</li>\n<li>2252_, [Windows]: <code>disk_usage()</code>_ fails on Python 3.12+.  (patch by\nMatthieu Darbois)</li>\n<li>2284_, [Linux]: <code>Process.memory_full_info()</code>_ may incorrectly raise\n<code>ZombieProcess</code>_ if it's determined via <code>/proc/pid/smaps_rollup</code>. Instead\nwe now fallback on reading <code>/proc/pid/smaps</code>.</li>\n<li>2287_, [OpenBSD], [NetBSD]: <code>Process.is_running()</code>_ erroneously return\n<code>False</code> for zombie processes, because creation time cannot be determined.</li>\n<li>2288_, [Linux]: correctly raise <code>ZombieProcess</code>_ on <code>Process.exe()</code><em>,\n<code>Process.cmdline()</code></em> and <code>Process.memory_maps()</code>_ instead of returning a\n&quot;null&quot; value.</li>\n<li>2290_: differently from what stated in the doc, PID reuse is not\npre-emptively checked for <code>Process.nice()</code>_ (set), <code>Process.ionice()</code><em>,\n(set), <code>Process.cpu_affinity()</code></em> (set), <code>Process.rlimit()</code>_\n(set), <code>Process.parent()</code>_.</li>\n<li>2308_, [OpenBSD]: <code>Process.threads()</code>_ always fail with AccessDenied (also as\nroot).</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/commit/8eb2930539e8030bae94255040a6254889c0fb05\"><code>8eb2930</code></a> pre-release</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/commit/8815b9baa219b925b1893ef4b68a7a01106bafc0\"><code>8815b9b</code></a> give CREDIT to <a href=\"https://github.com/JeremyGrosser\"><code>@\u200bJeremyGrosser</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/getsentry\"><code>@\u200bgetsentry</code></a> for sponsorship (thanks!)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/commit/5a37710b5c8f3a3b93bf5d1f91795812e64676ff\"><code>5a37710</code></a> Merge branch 'master' of github.com:giampaolo/psutil</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/commit/4a35f513ab5acf8329152f64da1eb22626dc1b52\"><code>4a35f51</code></a> fix error in test_contracts.py on win</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/commit/a7e70bb66d5823f2cdcdf0f950bdbf26875058b4\"><code>a7e70bb</code></a> chore: update GHA workflows (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/giampaolo/psutil/issues/2315\">#2315</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/commit/becbe86f6e5b686ad3cfaee3ea6afddffae82170\"><code>becbe86</code></a> fix <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/giampaolo/psutil/issues/2195\">#2195</a> / linux: no longer print exception at import time</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/commit/84cdeb426dc8f8083fffbbeff95c6ac7caa82e18\"><code>84cdeb4</code></a> Add ruff Python linter, remove flake8 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/giampaolo/psutil/issues/2312\">#2312</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/commit/e7ba381b77d24cdfbd1a1a8df9acd02db8e81e54\"><code>e7ba381</code></a> Add toml-sort linting tool for pyproject.toml (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/giampaolo/psutil/issues/2311\">#2311</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/commit/ddf9531858af0dc34121fd7a7a51f1ac30bd721c\"><code>ddf9531</code></a> new RTD config</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/commit/2cd8ef767a6d0bfa08ff45572feb55ea33774221\"><code>2cd8ef7</code></a> new RTD config</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/compare/release-5.9.5...release-5.9.6\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=psutil&package-manager=pip&previous-version=5.9.5&new-version=5.9.6)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
