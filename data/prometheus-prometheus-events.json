I then deleted the service and serviceMonitor, but the metric was still reporting. This was after 12 hours of the service and serviceMonitor not existing anymore.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2255\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-02-28 at 2 01 00 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2239830/221995713-4ce93032-b136-4c00-939d-c3b38c42f997.png\">\r\n\n\n### What did you expect to see?\n\nI expect to see a deleted service not be picked up by `prometheus_sd_discovered_targets` at some point after deletion.\n\n### What did you see instead? Under which circumstances?\n\nI saw `prometheus_sd_discovered_targets == 0` returning metrics for a service that was deleted many hours before. I did not see the service in the Service Discovery UI, so seems like the metric was only affected.\n\n### System information\n\nLinux 5.10.147+ x86_64\n\n### Prometheus version\n\n```text\nprometheus, version 2.40.5 (branch: HEAD, revision: 44af4716c86138869aa621737139e6dacf0e2550)\r\n  build user:       root@70f803b28803\r\n  build date:       20221201-12:50:06\r\n  go version:       go1.19.3\r\n  platform:         linux/amd64\n```\n\n\n### Prometheus configuration file\n\n_No response_\n\n### Alertmanager version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Alertmanager configuration file\n\n_No response_\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_",

This setting changes the keys from the whole string to a 32-byte checksum. \r\n\r\nThis consumes a lot less memory, at the cost of ~15% extra CPU and possible hash collisions. By \"birthday problem\" math the risk is about 1 in 2^128, or basically never.\r\n\r\nA SHA512/256 value is 32 bytes, compared to a metrics string at some hundreds of bytes.\r\nBenefit is biggest if you have a lot of dropped series, as described at #12443\r\n\r\nWe have two sets of maps so in the SHA case we can use a fixed-size byte array as the key and save a 16 byte string header; this does make the code a little uglier. Also `droppedSeriesSHA` contains `uint64` rather than `*uint64` which saves another 8 bytes, at the cost of an extra hash of the key each time it is looked up, which is quite cheap.\r\n\r\nIncluded are a couple of refactors, one which takes hundreds of lines of boilerplate out of scraping tests.\r\n\r\nExample results from profiling a Prometheus scraping ~2 million metrics, 500,000 of which are dropped:\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\n  386.01MB  9.39% 43.02%   386.01MB  9.39%  github.com/prometheus/prometheus/scrape.(*scrapeCache).addRef\r\n  260.94MB  6.35% 56.87%   260.94MB  6.35%  github.com/prometheus/prometheus/scrape.(*scrapeCache).addDropped\r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\n  190.36MB  4.70% 62.52%   190.36MB  4.70%  github.com/prometheus/prometheus/scrape.(*scrapeCache).addRefSHA \r\n   63.34MB  1.56% 90.51%    63.34MB  1.56%  github.com/prometheus/prometheus/scrape.(*scrapeCache).addDroppedSHA \r\n```",

This setting changes the keys from the whole string to a 32-byte checksum. \r\n\r\nThis consumes a lot less memory, at the cost of ~15% extra CPU and possible hash collisions. By \"birthday problem\" math the risk is about 1 in 2^128, or basically never.\r\n\r\nA SHA512/256 value is 32 bytes, compared to a metrics string at some hundreds of bytes.\r\nBenefit is biggest if you have a lot of dropped series, as described at #12443\r\n\r\nWe have two sets of maps so in the SHA case we can use a fixed-size byte array as the key and save a 16 byte string header; this does make the code a little uglier. Also `droppedSeriesSHA` contains `uint64` rather than `*uint64` which saves another 8 bytes, at the cost of an extra hash of the key each time it is looked up, which is quite cheap.\r\n\r\nIncluded are a couple of refactors, one which takes hundreds of lines of boilerplate out of scraping tests.\r\n\r\nExample results from profiling a Prometheus scraping ~2 million metrics, 500,000 of which are dropped:\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\n  386.01MB  9.39% 43.02%   386.01MB  9.39%  github.com/prometheus/prometheus/scrape.(*scrapeCache).addRef\r\n  260.94MB  6.35% 56.87%   260.94MB  6.35%  github.com/prometheus/prometheus/scrape.(*scrapeCache).addDropped\r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\n  190.36MB  4.70% 62.52%   190.36MB  4.70%  github.com/prometheus/prometheus/scrape.(*scrapeCache).addRefSHA \r\n   63.34MB  1.56% 90.51%    63.34MB  1.56%  github.com/prometheus/prometheus/scrape.(*scrapeCache).addDroppedSHA \r\n```",

Thanos),  not being able to truncate the WAL eventually means we are going to miss out on the (then) longer term metrics because there are no blocks generated to ship. \r\n\r\nAlso perhaps stating the obvious, but _just_ deleting the corrupted segment will then throw a:\r\n```\r\ncaller=main.go:1155 level=error err=\"opening storage failed: get segment range: segments are not sequential\"\r\n```\r\nwhich just (but please correct me if I'm wrong), no option other than to delete the WAL.\r\n",
