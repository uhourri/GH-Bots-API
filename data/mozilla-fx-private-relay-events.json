This is broken into its own task as it doesn\u2019t block the overall flow of onboarding. \r\n\r\nMajority of UI has been reused from existing screens. This will require a few new strings, but overall, it will require a bit of QA testing. \r\n\r\n# Screenshot (if applicable)\r\n\r\n https://vimeo.com/871702930/e8c8afdf67?share=copy\r\n\r\n# How to test\r\n\r\n- Make sure user profile you are using has onboarding state set to 0 - you can do this from the admin dashboard. \r\n- `free_user_onboarding` flag should be turned on as well. \r\n\r\n# Checklist (Definition of Done)\r\n- [ ] Product Owner accepted the User Story (demo of functionality completed) or waived the privilege.\r\n- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met.\r\n- [ ] Jira ticket has been updated (if needed) to match changes made during the development process.\r\n- [ ] I've added or updated relevant docs in the docs/ directory\r\n- [ ] Jira ticket has been updated (if needed) with suggestions for QA when this PR is deployed to stage.\r\n- [ ] All UI revisions follow the [coding standards](https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay/blob/main/docs/coding-standards.md), and use Protocol tokens where applicable (see `/frontend/src/styles/tokens.scss`).\r\n- [ ] Commits in this PR are minimal and [have descriptive commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).\r\n- [ ] l10n changes have been submitted to the l10n repository, if any.\r\n",

This is broken into its own task as it doesn\u2019t block the overall flow of onboarding. \r\n\r\nMajority of UI has been reused from existing screens. This will require a few new strings, but overall, it will require a bit of QA testing. \r\n\r\n# Screenshot (if applicable)\r\n\r\n https://vimeo.com/871702930/e8c8afdf67?share=copy\r\n\r\n# How to test\r\n\r\n- Make sure user profile you are using has onboarding state set to 0 - you can do this from the admin dashboard. \r\n- `free_user_onboarding` flag should be turned on as well. \r\n\r\n# Checklist (Definition of Done)\r\n- [ ] Product Owner accepted the User Story (demo of functionality completed) or waived the privilege.\r\n- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met.\r\n- [ ] Jira ticket has been updated (if needed) to match changes made during the development process.\r\n- [ ] I've added or updated relevant docs in the docs/ directory\r\n- [ ] Jira ticket has been updated (if needed) with suggestions for QA when this PR is deployed to stage.\r\n- [ ] All UI revisions follow the [coding standards](https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay/blob/main/docs/coding-standards.md), and use Protocol tokens where applicable (see `/frontend/src/styles/tokens.scss`).\r\n- [ ] Commits in this PR are minimal and [have descriptive commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).\r\n- [ ] l10n changes have been submitted to the l10n repository, if any.\r\n",

This is broken into its own task as it doesn\u2019t block the overall flow of onboarding. \r\n\r\nMajority of UI has been reused from existing screens. This will require a few new strings, but overall, it will require a bit of QA testing. \r\n\r\n# Screenshot (if applicable)\r\n\r\n https://vimeo.com/871702930/e8c8afdf67?share=copy\r\n\r\n# How to test\r\n\r\n- Make sure user profile you are using has onboarding state set to 0 - you can do this from the admin dashboard. \r\n- `free_user_onboarding` flag should be turned on as well. \r\n\r\n# Checklist (Definition of Done)\r\n- [ ] Product Owner accepted the User Story (demo of functionality completed) or waived the privilege.\r\n- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met.\r\n- [ ] Jira ticket has been updated (if needed) to match changes made during the development process.\r\n- [ ] I've added or updated relevant docs in the docs/ directory\r\n- [ ] Jira ticket has been updated (if needed) with suggestions for QA when this PR is deployed to stage.\r\n- [ ] All UI revisions follow the [coding standards](https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay/blob/main/docs/coding-standards.md), and use Protocol tokens where applicable (see `/frontend/src/styles/tokens.scss`).\r\n- [ ] Commits in this PR are minimal and [have descriptive commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).\r\n- [ ] l10n changes have been submitted to the l10n repository, if any.\r\n",

This is broken into its own task as it doesn\u2019t block the overall flow of onboarding. \r\n\r\nMajority of UI has been reused from existing screens. This will require a few new strings, but overall, it will require a bit of QA testing. \r\n\r\n# Screenshot (if applicable)\r\n\r\n https://vimeo.com/871702930/e8c8afdf67?share=copy\r\n\r\n# How to test\r\n\r\n- Make sure user profile you are using has onboarding state set to 0 - you can do this from the admin dashboard. \r\n- `free_user_onboarding` flag should be turned on as well. \r\n\r\n# Checklist (Definition of Done)\r\n- [ ] Product Owner accepted the User Story (demo of functionality completed) or waived the privilege.\r\n- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met.\r\n- [ ] Jira ticket has been updated (if needed) to match changes made during the development process.\r\n- [ ] I've added or updated relevant docs in the docs/ directory\r\n- [ ] Jira ticket has been updated (if needed) with suggestions for QA when this PR is deployed to stage.\r\n- [ ] All UI revisions follow the [coding standards](https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay/blob/main/docs/coding-standards.md), and use Protocol tokens where applicable (see `/frontend/src/styles/tokens.scss`).\r\n- [ ] Commits in this PR are minimal and [have descriptive commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).\r\n- [ ] l10n changes have been submitted to the l10n repository, if any.\r\n",

This is broken into its own task as it doesn\u2019t block the overall flow of onboarding. \r\n\r\nMajority of UI has been reused from existing screens. This will require a few new strings, but overall, it will require a bit of QA testing. \r\n\r\n# Screenshot (if applicable)\r\n\r\n https://vimeo.com/871702930/e8c8afdf67?share=copy\r\n\r\n# How to test\r\n\r\n- Make sure user profile you are using has onboarding state set to 0 - you can do this from the admin dashboard. \r\n- `free_user_onboarding` flag should be turned on as well. \r\n\r\n# Checklist (Definition of Done)\r\n- [ ] Product Owner accepted the User Story (demo of functionality completed) or waived the privilege.\r\n- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met.\r\n- [ ] Jira ticket has been updated (if needed) to match changes made during the development process.\r\n- [ ] I've added or updated relevant docs in the docs/ directory\r\n- [ ] Jira ticket has been updated (if needed) with suggestions for QA when this PR is deployed to stage.\r\n- [ ] All UI revisions follow the [coding standards](https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay/blob/main/docs/coding-standards.md), and use Protocol tokens where applicable (see `/frontend/src/styles/tokens.scss`).\r\n- [ ] Commits in this PR are minimal and [have descriptive commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).\r\n- [ ] l10n changes have been submitted to the l10n repository, if any.\r\n",

This is broken into its own task as it doesn\u2019t block the overall flow of onboarding. \r\n\r\nMajority of UI has been reused from existing screens. This will require a few new strings, but overall, it will require a bit of QA testing. \r\n\r\n# Screenshot (if applicable)\r\n\r\n https://vimeo.com/871702930/e8c8afdf67?share=copy\r\n\r\n# How to test\r\n\r\n- Make sure user profile you are using has onboarding state set to 0 - you can do this from the admin dashboard. \r\n- `free_user_onboarding` flag should be turned on as well. \r\n\r\n# Checklist (Definition of Done)\r\n- [ ] Product Owner accepted the User Story (demo of functionality completed) or waived the privilege.\r\n- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met.\r\n- [ ] Jira ticket has been updated (if needed) to match changes made during the development process.\r\n- [ ] I've added or updated relevant docs in the docs/ directory\r\n- [ ] Jira ticket has been updated (if needed) with suggestions for QA when this PR is deployed to stage.\r\n- [ ] All UI revisions follow the [coding standards](https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay/blob/main/docs/coding-standards.md), and use Protocol tokens where applicable (see `/frontend/src/styles/tokens.scss`).\r\n- [ ] Commits in this PR are minimal and [have descriptive commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).\r\n- [ ] l10n changes have been submitted to the l10n repository, if any.\r\n",

This is broken into its own task as it doesn\u2019t block the overall flow of onboarding. \r\n\r\nMajority of UI has been reused from existing screens. This will require a few new strings, but overall, it will require a bit of QA testing. \r\n\r\n# Screenshot (if applicable)\r\n\r\n https://vimeo.com/871702930/e8c8afdf67?share=copy\r\n\r\n# How to test\r\n\r\n- Make sure user profile you are using has onboarding state set to 0 - you can do this from the admin dashboard. \r\n- `free_user_onboarding` flag should be turned on as well. \r\n\r\n# Checklist (Definition of Done)\r\n- [ ] Product Owner accepted the User Story (demo of functionality completed) or waived the privilege.\r\n- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met.\r\n- [ ] Jira ticket has been updated (if needed) to match changes made during the development process.\r\n- [ ] I've added or updated relevant docs in the docs/ directory\r\n- [ ] Jira ticket has been updated (if needed) with suggestions for QA when this PR is deployed to stage.\r\n- [ ] All UI revisions follow the [coding standards](https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay/blob/main/docs/coding-standards.md), and use Protocol tokens where applicable (see `/frontend/src/styles/tokens.scss`).\r\n- [ ] Commits in this PR are minimal and [have descriptive commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).\r\n- [ ] l10n changes have been submitted to the l10n repository, if any.\r\n",

This is broken into its own task as it doesn\u2019t block the overall flow of onboarding. \r\n\r\nMajority of UI has been reused from existing screens. This will require a few new strings, but overall, it will require a bit of QA testing. \r\n\r\n# Screenshot (if applicable)\r\n\r\n https://vimeo.com/871702930/e8c8afdf67?share=copy\r\n\r\n# How to test\r\n\r\n- Make sure user profile you are using has onboarding state set to 0 - you can do this from the admin dashboard. \r\n- `free_user_onboarding` flag should be turned on as well. \r\n\r\n# Checklist (Definition of Done)\r\n- [ ] Product Owner accepted the User Story (demo of functionality completed) or waived the privilege.\r\n- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met.\r\n- [ ] Jira ticket has been updated (if needed) to match changes made during the development process.\r\n- [ ] I've added or updated relevant docs in the docs/ directory\r\n- [ ] Jira ticket has been updated (if needed) with suggestions for QA when this PR is deployed to stage.\r\n- [ ] All UI revisions follow the [coding standards](https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay/blob/main/docs/coding-standards.md), and use Protocol tokens where applicable (see `/frontend/src/styles/tokens.scss`).\r\n- [ ] Commits in this PR are minimal and [have descriptive commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).\r\n- [ ] l10n changes have been submitted to the l10n repository, if any.\r\n",

This is broken into its own task as it doesn\u2019t block the overall flow of onboarding. \r\n\r\nMajority of UI has been reused from existing screens. This will require a few new strings, but overall, it will require a bit of QA testing. \r\n\r\n# Screenshot (if applicable)\r\n\r\n https://vimeo.com/871702930/e8c8afdf67?share=copy\r\n\r\n# How to test\r\n\r\n- Make sure user profile you are using has onboarding state set to 0 - you can do this from the admin dashboard. \r\n- `free_user_onboarding` flag should be turned on as well. \r\n\r\n# Checklist (Definition of Done)\r\n- [ ] Product Owner accepted the User Story (demo of functionality completed) or waived the privilege.\r\n- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met.\r\n- [ ] Jira ticket has been updated (if needed) to match changes made during the development process.\r\n- [ ] I've added or updated relevant docs in the docs/ directory\r\n- [ ] Jira ticket has been updated (if needed) with suggestions for QA when this PR is deployed to stage.\r\n- [ ] All UI revisions follow the [coding standards](https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay/blob/main/docs/coding-standards.md), and use Protocol tokens where applicable (see `/frontend/src/styles/tokens.scss`).\r\n- [ ] Commits in this PR are minimal and [have descriptive commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).\r\n- [ ] l10n changes have been submitted to the l10n repository, if any.\r\n",

This is broken into its own task as it doesn\u2019t block the overall flow of onboarding. \r\n\r\nMajority of UI has been reused from existing screens. This will require a few new strings, but overall, it will require a bit of QA testing. \r\n\r\n# Screenshot (if applicable)\r\n\r\n https://vimeo.com/871702930/e8c8afdf67?share=copy\r\n\r\n# How to test\r\n\r\n- Make sure user profile you are using has onboarding state set to 0 - you can do this from the admin dashboard. \r\n- `free_user_onboarding` flag should be turned on as well. \r\n\r\n# Checklist (Definition of Done)\r\n- [ ] Product Owner accepted the User Story (demo of functionality completed) or waived the privilege.\r\n- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met.\r\n- [ ] Jira ticket has been updated (if needed) to match changes made during the development process.\r\n- [ ] I've added or updated relevant docs in the docs/ directory\r\n- [ ] Jira ticket has been updated (if needed) with suggestions for QA when this PR is deployed to stage.\r\n- [ ] All UI revisions follow the [coding standards](https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay/blob/main/docs/coding-standards.md), and use Protocol tokens where applicable (see `/frontend/src/styles/tokens.scss`).\r\n- [ ] Commits in this PR are minimal and [have descriptive commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).\r\n- [ ] l10n changes have been submitted to the l10n repository, if any.\r\n",

This is broken into its own task as it doesn\u2019t block the overall flow of onboarding. \r\n\r\nMajority of UI has been reused from existing screens. This will require a few new strings, but overall, it will require a bit of QA testing. \r\n\r\n# Screenshot (if applicable)\r\n\r\n https://vimeo.com/871702930/e8c8afdf67?share=copy\r\n\r\n# How to test\r\n\r\n- Make sure user profile you are using has onboarding state set to 0 - you can do this from the admin dashboard. \r\n- `free_user_onboarding` flag should be turned on as well. \r\n\r\n# Checklist (Definition of Done)\r\n- [ ] Product Owner accepted the User Story (demo of functionality completed) or waived the privilege.\r\n- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met.\r\n- [ ] Jira ticket has been updated (if needed) to match changes made during the development process.\r\n- [ ] I've added or updated relevant docs in the docs/ directory\r\n- [ ] Jira ticket has been updated (if needed) with suggestions for QA when this PR is deployed to stage.\r\n- [ ] All UI revisions follow the [coding standards](https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay/blob/main/docs/coding-standards.md), and use Protocol tokens where applicable (see `/frontend/src/styles/tokens.scss`).\r\n- [ ] Commits in this PR are minimal and [have descriptive commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).\r\n- [ ] l10n changes have been submitted to the l10n repository, if any.\r\n",

                "body": "This PR addresses:\r\n\r\n* MPP-3477 - `ValueError: Header values may not contain linefeed or carriage return characters` - This exact traceback no longer occurs, but may have moved to a different issue.\r\n* MPP-3503 - `IndexError: list index out of range` - should fix\r\n* MPP-3540 - `IndexError: list index out of range` - should also fix\r\n\r\nThis PR extends Python's [email.policy.default](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.policy.html) as `relay_policy` to change how emails headers are parsed.  The changes are:\r\n\r\n* Each email header has a new attribute `.as_unstructured` which represents the header if parsed as an unstructured header, rather than as an email address, date, etc. This allows logging something like the original value when the header is not RFC compliant.\r\n* The `Message-ID` header parser now catches `IndexError` and treats the header as an unstructured header.\r\n\r\nThis allows loading test emails with non-compliant headers, so they don't need to be stored as SNS JSON fixtures.\r\n\r\nIt also enables logging defect data for headers when forwarding an email, under warning message `\"_handle_received: forwarding issues\"`. The new code uses try / except blocks when reading and writing headers, and logs any exceptions. This will mean a few more emails are processed without killing the email task, but in other cases the error will be logged but the email will fail later in the process. The main benefit is to be able to see which headers are non-compliant and plan on how to handle them.\r\n\r\nThis PR also serializes the email before calling `ses_client.send_raw_email`, which will hopefully make serialization errors easier to distinguish from other SES client errors.\r\n\r\n## How to test:\r\n\r\nThis code adds extra logging for emails with headers that are not RFC compliant. I have not found a way to create these emails for interactive testing, so you'll have to be content with code inspection and automated testing.\r\n\r\n- [x] I've added a unit test to test for potential regressions of this bug.\r\n- [x] Commits in this PR are minimal and [have descriptive commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).\r\n",

We handle emails up to 10 MB, and hope to expand to 30 MB in the future. I think this is a case where any code smell is justified by the size of the data structures involved.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the problem this PR is trying to address is that AWS SES is receiving emails with headers that Python can't write, because in several cases it refuses to write a non-compliant header. Copying an email requires writing an email, so changing to a functional style would trigger the very errors we are trying to detect and avoid.\r\n\r\nI'd support inlining `_replace_headers` here and doing away with the function call entirely, if the style is too objectionable as it is.",

The changes are:\r\n\r\n* Each email header has a new attribute `.as_unstructured` which represents the header if parsed as an unstructured header, rather than as an email address, date, etc. This allows logging something like the original value when the header is not RFC compliant.\r\n* The `Message-ID` header parser now catches `IndexError` and treats the header as an unstructured header.\r\n\r\nThis allows loading test emails with non-compliant headers, so they don't need to be stored as SNS JSON fixtures.\r\n\r\nIt also enables logging defect data for headers when forwarding an email, under warning message `\"_handle_received: forwarding issues\"`. The new code uses try / except blocks when reading and writing headers, and logs any exceptions. This will mean a few more emails are processed without killing the email task, but in other cases the error will be logged but the email will fail later in the process. The main benefit is to be able to see which headers are non-compliant and plan on how to handle them.\r\n\r\nThis PR also serializes the email before calling `ses_client.send_raw_email`, which will hopefully make serialization errors easier to distinguish from other SES client errors.\r\n\r\n## How to test:\r\n\r\nThis code adds extra logging for emails with headers that are not RFC compliant. I have not found a way to create these emails for interactive testing, so you'll have to be content with code inspection and automated testing.\r\n\r\n- [x] I've added a unit test to test for potential regressions of this bug.\r\n- [x] Commits in this PR are minimal and [have descriptive commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).\r\n",

The changes are:\r\n\r\n* Each email header has a new attribute `.as_unstructured` which represents the header if parsed as an unstructured header, rather than as an email address, date, etc. This allows logging something like the original value when the header is not RFC compliant.\r\n* The `Message-ID` header parser now catches `IndexError` and treats the header as an unstructured header.\r\n\r\nThis allows loading test emails with non-compliant headers, so they don't need to be stored as SNS JSON fixtures.\r\n\r\nIt also enables logging defect data for headers when forwarding an email, under warning message `\"_handle_received: forwarding issues\"`. The new code uses try / except blocks when reading and writing headers, and logs any exceptions. This will mean a few more emails are processed without killing the email task, but in other cases the error will be logged but the email will fail later in the process. The main benefit is to be able to see which headers are non-compliant and plan on how to handle them.\r\n\r\nThis PR also serializes the email before calling `ses_client.send_raw_email`, which will hopefully make serialization errors easier to distinguish from other SES client errors.\r\n\r\n## How to test:\r\n\r\nThis code adds extra logging for emails with headers that are not RFC compliant. I have not found a way to create these emails for interactive testing, so you'll have to be content with code inspection and automated testing.\r\n\r\n- [x] I've added a unit test to test for potential regressions of this bug.\r\n- [x] Commits in this PR are minimal and [have descriptive commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).\r\n",

                "body": "This PR addresses:\r\n\r\n* MPP-3477 - `ValueError: Header values may not contain linefeed or carriage return characters` - This exact traceback no longer occurs, but may have moved to a different issue.\r\n* MPP-3503 - `IndexError: list index out of range` - should fix\r\n* MPP-3540 - `IndexError: list index out of range` - should also fix\r\n\r\nThis PR extends Python's [email.policy.default](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.policy.html) as `relay_policy` to change how emails headers are parsed.  The changes are:\r\n\r\n* Each email header has a new attribute `.as_unstructured` which represents the header if parsed as an unstructured header, rather than as an email address, date, etc. This allows logging something like the original value when the header is not RFC compliant.\r\n* The `Message-ID` header parser now catches `IndexError` and treats the header as an unstructured header.\r\n\r\nThis allows loading test emails with non-compliant headers, so they don't need to be stored as SNS JSON fixtures.\r\n\r\nIt also enables logging defect data for headers when forwarding an email, under warning message `\"_handle_received: forwarding issues\"`. The new code uses try / except blocks when reading and writing headers, and logs any exceptions. This will mean a few more emails are processed without killing the email task, but in other cases the error will be logged but the email will fail later in the process. The main benefit is to be able to see which headers are non-compliant and plan on how to handle them.\r\n\r\nThis PR also serializes the email before calling `ses_client.send_raw_email`, which will hopefully make serialization errors easier to distinguish from other SES client errors.\r\n\r\n## How to test:\r\n\r\nThis code adds extra logging for emails with headers that are not RFC compliant. I have not found a way to create these emails for interactive testing, so you'll have to be content with code inspection and automated testing.\r\n\r\n- [x] I've added a unit test to test for potential regressions of this bug.\r\n- [x] Commits in this PR are minimal and [have descriptive commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).\r\n",

The changes are:\r\n\r\n* Each email header has a new attribute `.as_unstructured` which represents the header if parsed as an unstructured header, rather than as an email address, date, etc. This allows logging something like the original value when the header is not RFC compliant.\r\n* The `Message-ID` header parser now catches `IndexError` and treats the header as an unstructured header.\r\n\r\nThis allows loading test emails with non-compliant headers, so they don't need to be stored as SNS JSON fixtures.\r\n\r\nIt also enables logging defect data for headers when forwarding an email, under warning message `\"_handle_received: forwarding issues\"`. The new code uses try / except blocks when reading and writing headers, and logs any exceptions. This will mean a few more emails are processed without killing the email task, but in other cases the error will be logged but the email will fail later in the process. The main benefit is to be able to see which headers are non-compliant and plan on how to handle them.\r\n\r\nThis PR also serializes the email before calling `ses_client.send_raw_email`, which will hopefully make serialization errors easier to distinguish from other SES client errors.\r\n\r\n## How to test:\r\n\r\nThis code adds extra logging for emails with headers that are not RFC compliant. I have not found a way to create these emails for interactive testing, so you'll have to be content with code inspection and automated testing.\r\n\r\n- [x] I've added a unit test to test for potential regressions of this bug.\r\n- [x] Commits in this PR are minimal and [have descriptive commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).\r\n",
