For example, I have the following build file in `myworkspace/mypkg`:\r\n```\r\ngo_library(\r\n  name = \"lib\",\r\n  srcs = [\r\n     \"lib.go\",\r\n     \"main.go\",\r\n  ],\r\n  data = glob([\"data_dir/**]),\r\n  deps = [\"@io_bazel_rules_go//go/runfiles\"],\r\n)\r\n\r\ngo_test(\r\n   name = \"test\",\r\n   srcs = [\"lib_test.go\"],\r\n   embed = [\":lib\"],\r\n)\r\n\r\ngo_binary(\r\n   name = \"main\",\r\n   embed = [\":lib\"]\r\n)\r\n```\r\nAnd both :test and :main targets runs the following:\r\n```\r\nrunfiles.Rlocation(\"myworkspace/mypkg/data_dir/my_runfile\")\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis worked as expected. :test target returned `<RUNFILES_DIR>/myworkspace/mypkg/data_dir/my_runfile`, while :main target returned `<WORKSPACE_DIR>/mypkg/data_dir/my_runfile`.\r\n\r\nHowever, if i update the path to its parent directory:\r\n```\r\nrunfiles.Rlocation(\"myworkspace/mypkg/data_dir\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis behavior was inconsistent: :test target still successfully returned  `<RUNFILES_DIR>/myworkspace/mypkg/data_dir`, but :main target return a \"file not found\" error (I think it hit [this line](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/blob/37ae8b3afc0a1d7e4a14c6b5df34f260931ec0fa/go/runfiles/manifest.go#L90) from the manifest.go implementation, where as the test target hit [this line](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/blob/37ae8b3afc0a1d7e4a14c6b5df34f260931ec0fa/go/runfiles/directory.go#L35) in the directory.go implementation). \r\n\r\nThis inconsistent behavior caught me by surprise. I would have expected the runfiles.Rlocation to either always check for validity, or never check for validity, regardless of if it's coming from a binary or a test target. \r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nConsistent behavior of runfiles.between go_test and go_binary target.\r\n",

For example, I have the following build file in `myworkspace/mypkg`:\r\n```\r\ngo_library(\r\n  name = \"lib\",\r\n  srcs = [\r\n     \"lib.go\",\r\n     \"main.go\",\r\n  ],\r\n  data = glob([\"data_dir/**]),\r\n  deps = [\"@io_bazel_rules_go//go/runfiles\"],\r\n)\r\n\r\ngo_test(\r\n   name = \"test\",\r\n   srcs = [\"lib_test.go\"],\r\n   embed = [\":lib\"],\r\n)\r\n\r\ngo_binary(\r\n   name = \"main\",\r\n   embed = [\":lib\"]\r\n)\r\n```\r\nAnd both :test and :main targets runs the following:\r\n```\r\nrunfiles.Rlocation(\"myworkspace/mypkg/data_dir/my_runfile\")\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis worked as expected. :test target returned `<RUNFILES_DIR>/myworkspace/mypkg/data_dir/my_runfile`, while :main target returned `<WORKSPACE_DIR>/mypkg/data_dir/my_runfile`.\r\n\r\nHowever, if i update the path to its parent directory:\r\n```\r\nrunfiles.Rlocation(\"myworkspace/mypkg/data_dir\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis behavior was inconsistent: :test target still successfully returned  `<RUNFILES_DIR>/myworkspace/mypkg/data_dir`, but :main target return a \"file not found\" error (I think it hit [this line](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/blob/37ae8b3afc0a1d7e4a14c6b5df34f260931ec0fa/go/runfiles/manifest.go#L90) from the manifest.go implementation, where as the test target hit [this line](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/blob/37ae8b3afc0a1d7e4a14c6b5df34f260931ec0fa/go/runfiles/directory.go#L35) in the directory.go implementation). \r\n\r\nThis inconsistent behavior caught me by surprise. I would have expected the runfiles.Rlocation to either always check for validity, or never check for validity, regardless of if it's coming from a binary or a test target. \r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nConsistent behavior of runfiles.between go_test and go_binary target.\r\n",

Why is it needed?**\r\nBy default, rules_go only generates Export files for the code it compiles using bazel, but not the stdlib. This is problematic for tools like golangci-lint that has analyzers that utilize the export files for their checks, including the stdlib.\r\n\r\nIt's possible to generate export files for the stdlib by passing the `-export` flag to the `go list` command, however, it comes with a time penalty (about 20s with the flag vs 2s without the flag).\r\n\r\nTherefore, add it as an option for go_register_toolchains.\r\n\r\nNow, you can do something like:\r\n```\r\ngo_register_toolchains(\r\n    exports_for_stdlib = True,\r\n    version = \"1.20.1\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it will generate the export files in the stdlib.pkg.json. Note that this time penalty only seems to be when using gopackagedriver not for regular builds. Another note is that it does change the existing behavior for the ExportFile field in the gopackagedriver output because it will no longer output an incorrect ExportFile for the stdlib (don't know if anyone was depending on that feature, because pkg.Target is always empty).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Which issues(s) does this PR fix?**\r\n\r\nFixes #3651\r\n\r\n",

Small bug\r\n   fixes and documentation improvements don't need issues.\r\n3. New features and bug fixes must have tests. Documentation may need to\r\n   be updated. If you're unsure what to update, send the PR, and we'll discuss\r\n   in review.\r\n4. Note that PRs updating dependencies and new Go versions are not accepted.\r\n   Please file an issue instead.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**What type of PR is this?**\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n**What does this PR do? Why is it needed?**\r\nCurrently the go_proto_compiler rule accepts custom proto compiler executables, but not the ability to pass custom input data in to the compiler runtime.\r\n\r\nThis change adds a `data` attribute to the `go_proto_compiler` rule. The data files provided are then appended to the input file list in the `go.actions.run` where the proto compiler is executed.\r\n\r\n**Which issues(s) does this PR fix?**\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/issues/3732\r\n\r\n**Other notes for review**\r\nLet me know what you are looking for regarding tests and I would be happy to add.\r\n",

Small bug\r\n   fixes and documentation improvements don't need issues.\r\n3. New features and bug fixes must have tests. Documentation may need to\r\n   be updated. If you're unsure what to update, send the PR, and we'll discuss\r\n   in review.\r\n4. Note that PRs updating dependencies and new Go versions are not accepted.\r\n   Please file an issue instead.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**What type of PR is this?**\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n**What does this PR do? Why is it needed?**\r\nCurrently the go_proto_compiler rule accepts custom proto compiler executables, but not the ability to pass custom input data in to the compiler runtime.\r\n\r\nThis change adds a `data` attribute to the `go_proto_compiler` rule. The data files provided are then appended to the input file list in the `go.actions.run` where the proto compiler is executed.\r\n\r\n**Which issues(s) does this PR fix?**\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/issues/3732\r\n\r\n**Other notes for review**\r\nLet me know what you are looking for regarding tests and I would be happy to add.\r\n",
