                "body": "Based on a [performance analysis taken of WordPress 6.2](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/05/25/wordpress-6-2-server-performance-analysis-summary/), the WP Performance Team determined that there was significant opportunity to improve the way that WordPress loads files and executes logic associated with the template rendering process for both classic themes and block themes.\r\n\r\n## Problem Exploration\r\n### Classic Theme Context\r\n\r\nConceptually, when WordPress handles a request for a specific page, it will render the HTML to send back in the response by parsing the request to see which type of page should be rendered, and then build the page by locating and processing the various template parts that make up the page. This includes executing any procedural code, including hook callbacks, present in these template files.\r\n\r\nFor example, when rendering a post page in the Twenty Twenty-One theme, locate_template is first called by `get_query_template`, which loads the `single.php` file, which then loads the header file, which loads a header template-part, which loads two more template-parts, etc. This process is repeated to render the content, and then the footer. The result (in this case) is 4 calls to `locate_template`, requiring the need to perform file operations, database queries, and procedural logic, just to render the page.\r\n\r\nNotably, `wp_head`\u2014which is called in the header template of most themes in order to render markup inside the `<head>` tag of the page\u2014is responsible for a bulk of the execution time as of WP 6.3 (an apparent regression from previous versions).\r\n\r\nDue to the dynamic nature of WordPress, this whole process is repeated for every request, even though the results of this process rarely change between requests. On high-traffic sites, this overhead is often avoided by putting a full page cache in front of the WordPress application. However, a more  granular way of caching and reusing specific template parts or even a whole page closer to the application does not currently exist.\r\n\r\n### Block Theme Context\r\n\r\nFor block themes, similar problems exist as described for classic themes. However, the template loading process is slightly different. Instead of locating and executing procedural code in PHP template files, `get_query_template` will first search for classic theme templates, before calling `locate_block_template` to see if a block template file exists and if any overrides are present as a custom post type in the database in `resolve_block_template`. \r\n\r\nOnce a block template is located, the content is stored in the `$_wp_current_template_content` global variable, where it is parsed into rendered block markup, and post processing is applied all within the `get_the_block_template_html` function. This leads to two potential problems:\r\n\r\n1. By separating the process of locating PHP templates and block templates in totally separate operations, unnecessary file operations can be run to locate a PHP template file that will be overridden by a block template of equal or higher specificity.\r\n2. By manually running post-processing filters on rendered block content in `get_the_block_template_html`, the same default filters that are added to hooks like `the_content` can get run twice, causing unnecessary double processing which adds performance overhead and even sometimes leads to bugs (see: https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55996).\r\n\r\n## Solutions to persue for WP 6.5\r\n\r\n### Add caching for template file lookups\r\nTo avoid repeated `file_exists` operations for the same templates that rarely change, we could cache the result of `get_query_template` and load them directly on subsequent requests.\r\n\r\n_Note:_ This effort should initially be time-boxed to include a discovery of whether PHPs internal stat cache renders the impact of these changes insignificant. See related conversation in: https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40731.\r\n\r\n**Related tickets:**\r\n- [ ] [59314 \u2013\u00a0Cache the result of template file lookups](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59314)\r\n- [ ] [59719 \u2013 Revise caching approach for theme files](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59719)\r\n- [ ] [59600 \u2013 Block themes: Use a cache for block templates and block template parts content](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59600)\r\n\r\n### Merge consideration of block-templates with classic template hierarchy\r\n\r\nFor block themes, WordPress will first attempt to locate the appropriate PHP template in the theme for the request before considering a block template. However, any block template that is found at an equal or higher priority takes precedence over the PHP templates. This means that block themes perform several unnecessary `file_exists` checks to look for a PHP template, when a block template is the desired result.\r\n\r\n**Related tickets:**\r\n- [ ] [59315 \u2013 Merge consideration of block-templates with classic template hierarchy](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59315)\r\n\r\n### Reduce or eliminate cost of template part block instance variations\r\n\r\nThe function `build_template_part_block_instance_variations` is called when the template part block is registered, and is responsible for ~10% of the total server time for rendering a page in a block theme in WP 6.3 ([profiling analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WICTFAn2pOeVlYgpBzLU8Uh-77zQF3_ZO3N97LLlVdU/edit#gid=802202677)). This is primarily due to `get_block_templates()`, which is called internally by this function. That function performs two tasks that make up a bulk of the time: performing an expensive query and getting block template files (via `_get_block_template_files()` which eventually results in an expensive call to `WP_Theme_JSON_Resolver::get_theme_data`.\r\n\r\n**Related tickets:**\r\n- [ ] [57789 - Make theme.json related caches persistent](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57789)\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/45601\r\n\r\n### Make caching for global style sheets persistent\r\nThe function `wp_get_global_stylesheet` is responsible for ~10% of server execution time ([WP 6.3 profiling data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WICTFAn2pOeVlYgpBzLU8Uh-77zQF3_ZO3N97LLlVdU/edit#gid=802202677)) in classic themes. While it is cached in some scenarios, it may not be a persistent cache, which creates a large server response time regression since WP 6.1 when the function was introduced.\r\n\r\n**Related tickets:** \r\n- [ ] [57789 - Make theme.json related caches persistent](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57789)\r\n- [x] [57648 \u2013\u00a0Performance regression in `wp_enqueue_global_styles()` for classic themes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57648)\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous improvements to template loading\r\nWhile the above solutions focus on specific solutions, additional optimizations that reduce or eliminate unnecessary file operations are also worth pursuing.\r\n\r\n**Related tickets:**\r\n- [ ] [58196 \u2013\u00a0Improve performance of `_get_block_templates_paths`](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/58196)\r\n- [x] [58319 \u2013 Improve performance of get_block_theme_folders](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/58319)\r\n- [x] [59279 \u2013\u00a0Unnecessarily check to see site is using a child theme in the theme functions](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59279)\r\n- [x] [58576 \u2013 locate_template does not check to see site has parent theme](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/58576)\r\n",

If this PR does not fix the entire issue, change this to Addresses #... instead. -->\r\nFixes #805\r\n\r\n## Relevant technical choices\r\n\r\nWhen the module is active, the output buffering UI elements for Server Timing are omitted since the Image Loading Optimization module always does output buffering. Similarly, when the module is running, Server Timing will wait to send the header at the end of the new `perflab_template_output_buffer` filter.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] PR has either `[Focus]` or `Infrastructure` label.\r\n- [x] PR has a `[Type]` label.\r\n- [x] PR has a milestone or the `no milestone` label.\r\n",

                "body": "Based on a [performance analysis taken of WordPress 6.2](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/05/25/wordpress-6-2-server-performance-analysis-summary/), the WP Performance Team determined that there was significant opportunity to improve the way that WordPress loads files and executes logic associated with the template rendering process for both classic themes and block themes.\r\n\r\n## Problem Exploration\r\n### Classic Theme Context\r\n\r\nConceptually, when WordPress handles a request for a specific page, it will render the HTML to send back in the response by parsing the request to see which type of page should be rendered, and then build the page by locating and processing the various template parts that make up the page. This includes executing any procedural code, including hook callbacks, present in these template files.\r\n\r\nFor example, when rendering a post page in the Twenty Twenty-One theme, locate_template is first called by `get_query_template`, which loads the `single.php` file, which then loads the header file, which loads a header template-part, which loads two more template-parts, etc. This process is repeated to render the content, and then the footer. The result (in this case) is 4 calls to `locate_template`, requiring the need to perform file operations, database queries, and procedural logic, just to render the page.\r\n\r\nNotably, `wp_head`\u2014which is called in the header template of most themes in order to render markup inside the `<head>` tag of the page\u2014is responsible for a bulk of the execution time as of WP 6.3 (an apparent regression from previous versions).\r\n\r\nDue to the dynamic nature of WordPress, this whole process is repeated for every request, even though the results of this process rarely change between requests. On high-traffic sites, this overhead is often avoided by putting a full page cache in front of the WordPress application. However, a more  granular way of caching and reusing specific template parts or even a whole page closer to the application does not currently exist.\r\n\r\n### Block Theme Context\r\n\r\nFor block themes, similar problems exist as described for classic themes. However, the template loading process is slightly different. Instead of locating and executing procedural code in PHP template files, `get_query_template` will first search for classic theme templates, before calling `locate_block_template` to see if a block template file exists and if any overrides are present as a custom post type in the database in `resolve_block_template`. \r\n\r\nOnce a block template is located, the content is stored in the `$_wp_current_template_content` global variable, where it is parsed into rendered block markup, and post processing is applied all within the `get_the_block_template_html` function. This leads to two potential problems:\r\n\r\n1. By separating the process of locating PHP templates and block templates in totally separate operations, unnecessary file operations can be run to locate a PHP template file that will be overridden by a block template of equal or higher specificity.\r\n2. By manually running post-processing filters on rendered block content in `get_the_block_template_html`, the same default filters that are added to hooks like `the_content` can get run twice, causing unnecessary double processing which adds performance overhead and even sometimes leads to bugs (see: https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55996).\r\n\r\n## Solutions to persue for WP 6.5\r\n\r\n### Add caching for template file lookups\r\nTo avoid repeated `file_exists` operations for the same templates that rarely change, we could cache the result of `get_query_template` and load them directly on subsequent requests.\r\n\r\n**Related tickets:**\r\n- [ ] [59314 \u2013\u00a0Cache the result of template file lookups](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59314)\r\n- [ ] [59600 \u2013 Block themes: Use a cache for block templates and block template parts content](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59600)\r\n\r\n### Merge consideration of block-templates with classic template hierarchy\r\n\r\nFor block themes, WordPress will first attempt to locate the appropriate PHP template in the theme for the request before considering a block template. However, any block template that is found at an equal or higher priority takes precedence over the PHP templates. This means that block themes perform several unnecessary `file_exists` checks to look for a PHP template, when a block template is the desired result.\r\n\r\n**Related tickets:**\r\n- [ ] [59315 \u2013 Merge consideration of block-templates with classic template hierarchy](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59315)\r\n\r\n### Reduce or eliminate cost of template part block instance variations\r\n\r\nThe function `build_template_part_block_instance_variations` is called when the template part block is registered, and is responsible for ~10% of the total server time for rendering a page in a block theme in WP 6.3 ([profiling analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WICTFAn2pOeVlYgpBzLU8Uh-77zQF3_ZO3N97LLlVdU/edit#gid=802202677)). This is primarily due to `get_block_templates()`, which is called internally by this function. That function performs two tasks that make up a bulk of the time: performing an expensive query and getting block template files (via `_get_block_template_files()` which eventually results in an expensive call to `WP_Theme_JSON_Resolver::get_theme_data`.\r\n\r\n**Related tickets:**\r\n- [ ] [57789 - Make theme.json related caches persistent](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57789)\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/45601\r\n\r\n### Make caching for global style sheets persistent\r\nThe function `wp_get_global_stylesheet` is responsible for ~10% of server execution time ([WP 6.3 profiling data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WICTFAn2pOeVlYgpBzLU8Uh-77zQF3_ZO3N97LLlVdU/edit#gid=802202677)) in classic themes. While it is cached in some scenarios, it may not be a persistent cache, which creates a large server response time regression since WP 6.1 when the function was introduced.\r\n\r\n**Related tickets:** \r\n- [ ] [57789 - Make theme.json related caches persistent](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57789)\r\n- [x] [57648 \u2013\u00a0Performance regression in `wp_enqueue_global_styles()` for classic themes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57648)\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous improvements to template loading\r\nWhile the above solutions focus on specific solutions, additional optimizations that reduce or eliminate unnecessary file operations are also worth pursuing.\r\n\r\n**Related tickets:**\r\n- [ ] [58196 \u2013\u00a0Improve performance of `_get_block_templates_paths`](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/58196)\r\n- [ ] [58319 \u2013 Improve performance of get_block_theme_folders](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/58319)\r\n- [x] [59279 \u2013\u00a0Unnecessarily check to see site is using a child theme in the theme functions](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59279)\r\n- [x] [58576 \u2013 locate_template does not check to see site has parent theme](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/58576)\r\n",

                "body": "> Still, I wonder what is making us not trust it?\r\n\r\nSimply put: sometimes the reported _median_ `wp-total` can be e.g. 50ms, and in the next run it can be 80ms. Makes it a bit hard to build trust and to find outliers.\r\n\r\n> eliminate as much external bias from the benchmarks as is possible.\r\n\r\nYeah that's probably better worded. This is partially what I'm looking into right now. Cron, external http requests, etc.\r\n\r\n> at the cost of intentionally ignoring the worst performance issues, one way we can start if we haven't already, is to ignore outliers in the data before reporting any metrics. this can't happen if we are updating a metric as we go, such as the average. \r\n\r\nAt least we're using medians right now to ignore outliers, so that's a start.\r\n\r\n> we'd need to have every sample before computing the aggregate measures so that we can determine if a given sample is an outlier or not. taking this one step further we can always expose that raw data for further review.\r\n\r\nThat's a long term goal; just putting all the raw numbers into something like Grafana and then do further analysis there.\r\n\r\n> empty testing sites are so unrealistic that the numbers don't mean too much.\r\n\r\nFWIW core is not using empty sites. We use https://github.com/WordPress/theme-test-data as the base. Not hundred posts, but it's a start. But agreed that's still far away from a \"typical\" small WordPress site.\r\n",

                "body": "> It looks like GitHub Actions workers aren't producing consistent enough results.\r\n\r\nI've spent a considerable amount of time working with GitHub Actions in Gutenberg and overall it has been more reliable than I expected based on all the testing we've done. That is, all of the problems we've experienced with performance testing problems have been resolved in the Gutenberg test runners, not by jumping off of GitHub Actions.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing this will be harder in Core because I think there's evidence that we should be running our tests for at least a couple hours before drawing conclusions when testing \"the small\", and GitHub Actions has a cut off of six hours. Still, I wonder what is making us not trust it?\r\n\r\nIs there more we can talk about to uncover the problems there? I suspect some of the problems we've witnessed on GitHub Actions are present in every testing environment, even the most isolated and controlled.\r\n\r\n> running a benchmark twice against the exact same WordPress site should result in the exact same load time metrics\r\n\r\nWant to concur with this and also note the major caveat that we often have different runtime modes in Core that are based on certain computations and caches having already been handled or not. For instance, a site quickly reaches out to download the list of plugin versions for updates and that slows down one or more early requests, and we could disable this and all of transient behaviors, but then we'd be intentionally overlooking things that have real and measurable performance impacts for the sake of establishing stability in the reported numbers.\r\n\r\nWe can force identical results from the benchmark and still miss the mark. A different way I think we could talk about your goal is to _eliminate as much external bias from the benchmarks as is possible_.\r\n\r\nit's quite possible that in the pursuit of eliminating variability in the testing we might find issues that are in Core. one possibility here would be finding things that themselves are performance optimizations that make average requests faster but occasionally make requests much slower.\r\n\r\nwe may not be able to eliminate variability because it might be inherent in the code (could be something as indirect as MySQL performing maintenance work, which isn't related to WordPress, but is related in that it happens \"out there\" in the deployed world and WordPress has some way it responds to that which affects sites). we _may_ be able to start identifying clusters that represent those different code paths and try to benchmark them separately to understand their behavior, or examine ways to eliminate the clusters and re-unify the runtime performance.\r\n\r\nat the cost of intentionally ignoring the worst performance issues, one way we can start if we haven't already, is to ignore outliers in the data before reporting any metrics. this can't happen if we are updating a metric as we go, such as the average. we'd need to have every sample before computing the aggregate measures so that we can determine if a given sample is an outlier or not. (and I say \"outlier\" but mostly I think many of these will be page renders that are much slower because they are doing more work than most requests).\r\n\r\ntaking this one step further we can always expose that raw data for further review. I've done this a few times in Gutenberg where we can save the raw data as an artifact on a CI performance test run in addition to reporting the averages and deltas for a PR. usually that artifact is ignored, but it's incredibly useful to have when you find something surprising in a test run.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm on the hunt for a large and representatively complicated website. empty testing sites are so unrealistic that the numbers don't mean too much. it's like comparing different implementations of a function to count grapheme clusters in a string, but only testing on empty strings. I'm guessing that certain things in WordPress that _aren't_ performance sensitive are being over-emphasized.\r\n\r\nOn that note the `twentytwentyfour` home page might be a good change in introducing a lot of complexity on the home page because it will recenter the metrics on things that have more of a normal impact, but it would still be better I think if we had a site with a hundred posts, a thousand comments, lots of media, and lots of customization, maybe even having a handful of common plugins installed.\r\n\r\nWe can perform database dumps and restores to start in a pristine state on each run.",

The resource size (mb) - is the image compressed etc\r\n3. How its served and where its served from (server vs CDN)\r\n4. How soon the browser renders the image\r\n\r\nThere are a number of things out of our control here, especially from a server, caching and infrastructure perspective. But we can look at preloading that image if we can identify that it is in fact the LCP on the page. This spoken about here on `web.dev` in detail: https://web.dev/optimize-lcp/#preload-important-resources especially for responsive images.\r\n",

                "body": "Thank you for clearing things up, @westonruter! Looks like I misunderstood you on a few points, sorry about that.\r\n\r\n> Agreed. I did not intend to say that we add link preloads powered by the current PHP-based heuristics. We need client-side detection to obtain real user metrics to ensure the right elements are prioritized for the client viewport. I have written up a document for [Image Loading Optimization via Client-side Detection](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16qAJ7I_ljhEdx2Cn2VlK7IkiixobY9zNn8FXxN9T9Ls/edit?usp=sharing). I'll be creating issues out of this.\r\n\r\nThank you, and I agree that's a great step forward if we can pull it off! \ud83d\udc4d\r\n\r\n> There's an easy way to work around this. Simply [omit](https://web.dev/articles/preload-responsive-images#:~:text=Note%20that%20by%20excluding%20the,the%20preload%20in%20this%20case.) the `href` attribute while retaining `imagesrcset`.\r\n\r\nThat's a good approach! [The spec seems to confirm this possibility](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#attr-link-imagesrcset), so the expectation is that all implementations going forward will handle a missing `href` correctly \ud83d\udc4d\r\n\r\n> That being said, 75% of browsers currently [support](https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_link_imagesrcset) responsive preloads.\r\n\r\nRight, we just need to ensure that for any feature we decide to use, we're not actively making things worse on unsupported browsers. Unsupported leading to a no-op is absolutely fine (that's textbook progressive enhancement), but unsupported leading to worse performance than before is something we should avoid. And your suggestion does indeed avoid it \ud83d\udc4d\r\n\r\n> So if we can greatly improve the accuracy of detecting the LCP element across all viewports, we can start to be more aggressive about optimizing. But if the accuracy is not as high as we like, and there is only one LCP element across viewports, then we can rely on Priority Hints alone.\r\n\r\nYes, I generally agree, although I think we should probably run some more extensive testing before ramping up the aggressiveness. We need to account for a wide variety of scenarios in the performance numbers.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we'd have a corpus of real sites we could test against. A possible automated approach would be to find existing `fetchpriority` attributes and use Chrome's local overrides feature to locally rewrite the HTML (to e.g. include `preload` as well), so that we could test multiple variations on real sites without access to the servers.",

Improving the loading performance of the Largest Contentful Paint image is one of the hallmarks of keeping LCP scores in the green. However, doing so has proven relatively tricky. \r\n\r\nIn order to reduce LCP, we need to consider a few things:\r\n1. The size (dimensions of the image)\r\n2. The resource size (mb) - is the image compressed etc\r\n3. How its served and where its served from (server vs CDN)\r\n4. How soon the browser renders the image\r\n\r\nThere are a number of things out of our control here, especially from a server, caching and infrastructure perspective. But we can look at preloading that image if we can identify that it is in fact the LCP on the page. This spoken about here on `web.dev` in detail: https://web.dev/optimize-lcp/#preload-important-resources especially for responsive images.\r\n",

                "body": "@sgomes, thanks for the reply.\r\n\r\n> Thank you for this analysis, @westonruter!\r\n> \r\n> I think something else that we need to consider is the cost of getting things **wrong**. If we're talking about the heuristics only getting things right 50% of the time, that means we're downloading an unnecessary image (at that stage) 50% of the time, potentially making LCP **higher** than if we were to do nothing.\r\n> \r\n> That's not great as is, but using preload to fetch that image at a higher priority would make things even worse.\r\n> \r\n> As such, I think it's premature to be talking about preloading when our heuristics get things wrong so often; I agree that our focus should be on improving our guesses.\r\n\r\nAgreed. I did not intend to say that we add link preloads powered by the current PHP-based heuristics. We need client-side detection to obtain real user metrics to ensure the right elements are prioritized for the client viewport. I have written up a document for [Image Loading Optimization via Client-side Detection](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16qAJ7I_ljhEdx2Cn2VlK7IkiixobY9zNn8FXxN9T9Ls/edit?usp=sharing). I'll be creating issues out of this.\r\n\r\n> But even if our heuristics were to improve, I still want to express my opposition to using `preload` on guessed LCP images altogether; remember that **browsers that don't support `imagesrcset` in `<link rel=\"preload\">` (such as all WebKit browsers) will ignore that attribute and download the wrong image at a high priority**. As I see it, that's reason enough to scrap that approach, as it's not fair to actively make things worse on a major engine in order to potentially improve scores slightly on the other two.\r\n\r\nThere's an easy way to work around this. Simply [omit](https://web.dev/articles/preload-responsive-images#:~:text=Note%20that%20by%20excluding%20the,the%20preload%20in%20this%20case.) the `href` attribute while retaining `imagesrcset`. That being said, 75% of browsers currently [support](https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_link_imagesrcset) responsive preloads.\r\n\r\n> This sort of thing is exactly what `fetchpriority` was built for, and the results it brings are a better tradeoff between correct guess and wrong guess scenarios than `preload` would be, while gracefully degrading to a no-op in browsers without support.\r\n\r\nYes, I agree. In my last paragraph I say: \"All this being said, if the same element is the LCP image for both desktop and mobile, then the current approach to rely on Priority Hints is fine. Nevertheless, adding `preload` seems to improve LCP yet further at least on this demo site.\" So if we can greatly improve the accuracy of detecting the LCP element across all viewports, we can start to be more aggressive about optimizing. But if the accuracy is not as high as we like, and there is only one LCP element across viewports, then we can rely on Priority Hints alone.",

                "body": "## Bug Description\r\n\r\nWhen deploying standalone plugins, it looks like at the moment the `.wordpress-org` directories for them are actually deployed to WordPress.org, as part of the actual plugin. The files in that directory should only be deployed into the SVN repository's `assets` folder, which works as expected, but additionally the `.wordpress-org` directory is also added to the plugin itself. This is unnecessary and notably increases the plugin ZIP size, so it should be fixed.\r\n\r\nI discovered this bug when doing a `DRY_RUN` for the Dominant Color Images plugin (see https://github.com/WordPress/performance/actions/runs/6425426416/job/17447991722#step:6:100).\r\nAfter that I checked the existing standalone plugins and found the bug already present there too, see below:\r\n* https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/webp-uploads/trunk/.wordpress-org\r\n* https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/fetchpriority/trunk/.wordpress-org\r\n* https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/dominant-color-images/trunk/.wordpress-org\r\n\r\n**Note:** This is _only_ a problem for the standalone plugins, not for the main Performance Lab plugin.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n* We need to ensure that the `.wordpress-org` directory for each standalone plugin is not deployed as part of the plugin itself (i.e. within the plugin's SVN `trunk` directory).\r\n* While fixing that, we must however ensure that the files from the `.wordpress-org` directory continue to be considered for the plugin's SVN `assets` directory.\r\n* Since this bug is already in production for `webp-uploads` and `fetchpriority`, and `dominant-color-images`, we should probably as part of the PR also bump the version of those plugins as a patch version increase, so that upon the next deployment the problem is fixed.\r\n* `fetchpriority` is no longer part of the repository, so we can ignore that part.",
