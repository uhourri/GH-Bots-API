                "body": "Another follow up to #15084 and #15364. Fixes #15416.\r\nEdit: This is a WIP; don't expect exporting to work (thumbnail generation is thus also broken). Or slideshow. Snapshots and duplicates that have different crop/zoom/position/rotation than the on-screen image will also look weird.\r\n\r\nThe visible effect of this PR is twofold:\r\n- when the crop of the image in darkroom is switched on or off, for example because the crop module itself or the retouch or liquify modules are (de)focused, the previously visible high resolution image is repositioned and rescaled to the exact new spot where it will end up, while the full image is being recalculated. When \"zooming in\" (the crop module loses focus; the crop is switched on) this means you should immediately see the correct image, but after the recalculation finishes it will be a little sharper. When \"zooming out\" (the crop/retouch/liquifty module is focused; the crop is temporarily switched off) this means that the \"center\" of the image will likely be sharper for a little while than the area around it, which may first be black and then pixilated while a scaled up version of the left-top corner preview is shown until the full recalculation finishes.\r\nIn the most extreme case (the crop margins are zero) this should avoid the problem @TurboGit reported here #15286 (no flickering), but it should help in a lot more cases. It also replaces the hacky solution I implemented here #15222.\r\n- when we are currently zoomed in to a cropped image, focusing a module that temporarily switches off cropping (like crop itself but also retouch and liquify) would cause the shown image to move to a completely different area. This is no longer the case, although the image may still be slightly repositioned to move it to center.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR was a hellish journey again. To help understand what was needed to be changed and possibly predict/understand some side effects, I'll give a bit of background, also serving maybe as some kind of \"documentation\" when further changes are considered. Such documentation is completely lacking at the moment as far as I can tell and otherwise probably would not really reflect the actual current implementation and behavior anyway, so might have been worse than the nothing we have.\r\n\r\nIn the darkroom we have a multitude of coordinate systems to describe a spot in the image:\r\n1. relative position in terms of the \"complete\" image (the one shown in miniature in the top-left navigator window. This goes from horizontal 0-100% (left-right) and vertical 0-100% (top-bottom).\r\n2. same, but in pixels 0-720 horizontal 0-350 vertical (or a portion of this based on aspect ratio).\r\n3. actually, the buffer defined in 2. is only partially used if `preview_downsampling` is set to 1/2, 1/3 or 1/4.\r\n4. pixel position within the full calculated image based on applied crops/framing/rotation etc. This could be, say 0-3k horizontal and 0-2k vertical for a 24mpixel image that is cropped 50% in both directions.\r\n5. position within the central area of the darkroom. On an FHD monitor, full screen and with all panels hidden, this would be 0-1920 and 0-1080. This still includes a narrow border around the image (set in prefs) and a big white+black border if color calibration mode is switched on.\r\n6. relative position within the currently shown (zoomed) image in the central area of the darkroom (0-100% both).\r\n7. same, but in pixels. This is 5 minus the borders.\r\n8. - 10. same as 5-7 but for the second preview window.\r\n11. corresponding position of any of the previous points in terms of the original raw file. In 0-100%. The 50% crop in 4. could for example be 50-100% and 25-75%, if the right half of the image positioned centrally vertically was used.\r\n12. same in pixels; 3k-6k and 1k-3k for the example above.\r\n\r\nThese coordinate system are used while redrawing the screen and processing mouse moves and clicks and when dealing with visual elements like mask shapes, color picker areas and crop or perspective handles etc etc. Variables names don't indicate what coordinate system an \"x\" or \"y\" lives in (or at least I haven't discovered the consistency and I haven't myself improved the situation I'm sure). In _most_ places, we somehow reference back to a position within the \"full\" (i.e. current crop) image, but scaled down, that is shown in the navigator window (2. i.e. not necessarily corrected for downsampling; this correction needed to be applied every time before anything was done with it, so _all_ the individual modules etc were dealing with downsampling over and over again).\r\n\r\nWe have \"current positions\" for the center screen and the second preview window and the last calculated zoomed in \"preview\" for each of these, which may have been from a time that a crop was or wasn't active that currently isn't or is.\r\n\r\nBasically, this PR stores the current position and the positions of the calculated previews in coordinate system 12 (the context of the RAW file, which is immutable) and then when drawing positions them on the center and second preview areas based on current crop and zoom levels and locations.\r\n\r\nThat sounds trivial and to avoid introducing a lot of new bugs one obviously tries to be minimally invasive when making changes and reconnecting to existing code. But similar past changes introduced back and forth conversions everywhere to the extend that it really impossible to comprehend what is going on. So I had to try to create some order out of chaos. Again, starting with not making too big changes so that the impact could more easily be tested, but eventually in frustration, because it was impossible to get everything to line up, ending up completely ripping out _all_ the references to downsampling and instead at startup reducing the dimensions of the \"preview\" (navigator) miniature. This miraculously got rid of a lot of issues with no problems introduced as far as I could tell (please _do_ tell if you find any). Similarly, after calculating a preview image (full res) for the zoomed+cropped, the resoluting pixmap would be stored in a variable (with associated dimension variables) called \"backbuf\". For some reason, at some point a duplicate of these variables called \"output_backbuf\" was created and extensively used. Because the dimensions of the pixmap are somewhat related (after scaling) to the common \"standard\" of the full \"preview\" pixmap, the code ended up with references to `output_backbuf_width/height` everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe output buffers are only available once the calculations are finished (which doesn't happen at the same time for the preview/full/preview2 pipes) so their sizes and zoom levels get out of sync with the current zoom and crop. This PR tries to base the shown image on the actual current zoom and crop levels, but unfortunately can't convert RAW dimensions back and forth to the current zoomed-and-cropped screen image until a pipe has been refreshed based on the current history (which gets partly flushed whenever a module (un)focus happens) and might not get recreated soon if a long calculation is already underway. And many modules don't draw their visual elements anyway until the _preview_ is available...\r\n\r\nSo, yeah, this PR is not perfect. Further improvements will need work done on cache and possibly pipe handling. I may start an issue to discuss my thoughts there first, because I definitely want to tap into the knowledge of @TurboGit and @jenshannoschwalm  and possibly others who currently know more about those areas than I do, because the changes required would be somewhat extensive and gradual steps are not likely to be productive.\r\n\r\nThings you will notice when testing this PR:\r\n- snapshots and duplicates work, but if they are activated while the currently visible image has a wildly different size, crop or  orientation, they will be shown in an odd location.\r\n- slideshow is not connected up to the new approach at all yet; it doesn't work.\r\n- When rotating the image, the scaled preview and repositioned last calculated full view will be temporarily combined in an odd juxtaposition. It is probably necessary to determine and store the rotation (and flip) of a calculated image relative to the original raw when a pipe calculation finishes and the result is stored in the backbuf. We can then ask cairo to rotate+flip as an approximation or just temporarily hide the last full res image. Previously this wasn't an issue because we just continued showing the old image in the same location while the recalc was ongoing; we were not attempting to relocate/zoom to a predicted new location.\r\n\r\nPlease give this PR a go and tell me your thoughts; any specific cases that you feel might need special handling and are not getting it here. Any showstoppers that might make it practically infeasible to get this approach working correctly ever. Or just any questions the above has raised for you or that could be explained (much) better.\r\n\r\nEDIT: when testing changes like these, that are intended to make working with sets of heavy modules on slower machines (laptops lacking GPUs for example) bearable and on faster machines more fluid, it makes sense to test with some serious modules (d&s, blurs, liquify) enabled and possibly even switch off OpenCL.\r\n\r\nEDIT 2: This also fixes some memory leaks in snapshots and duplicates; pixmap bufs were allocated and filled and then cairo surfaces based on them. The surfaces were correctly destroyed afterwards, but since they didn't take ownership of the pixmaps, those still need to be `dt_free_align`ed as well.",

                "body": "FWIW, I think that auto-closing issues (and the related warnings from the bot) is a bad policy. A lot of successful FOSS projects have outstanding issues that have been open for years, if not decades. This does not mean that they are irrelevant, and won't be fixed at some point. Even if the OP cannot fix them, someone may come along in due course, or find a host of related issues when doing a refactoring, etc.\r\n\r\nI understand that having a lot of open issues can be disheartening as a maintainer, but it is effectively harmless when handled appropriately. Labeling, periodic culling and re-triage of issues is a much better policy. See eg this [recent discussion at Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/103151) and their [subsequent solution](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/28266).",

                "body": "Another follow up to #15084 and #15364. Fixes #15416.\r\nEdit: This is a WIP; don't expect exporting to work (thumbnail generation is thus also broken). Or slideshow. Snapshots and duplicates that have different crop/zoom/position/rotation than the on-screen image will also look weird.\r\n\r\nThe visible effect of this PR is twofold:\r\n- when the crop of the image in darkroom is switched on or off, for example because the crop module itself or the retouch or liquify modules are (de)focused, the previously visible high resolution image is repositioned and rescaled to the exact new spot where it will end up, while the full image is being recalculated. When \"zooming in\" (the crop module loses focus; the crop is switched on) this means you should immediately see the correct image, but after the recalculation finishes it will be a little sharper. When \"zooming out\" (the crop/retouch/liquifty module is focused; the crop is temporarily switched off) this means that the \"center\" of the image will likely be sharper for a little while than the area around it, which may first be black and then pixilated while a scaled up version of the left-top corner preview is shown until the full recalculation finishes.\r\nIn the most extreme case (the crop margins are zero) this should avoid the problem @TurboGit reported here #15286 (no flickering), but it should help in a lot more cases. It also replaces the hacky solution I implemented here #15222.\r\n- when we are currently zoomed in to a cropped image, focusing a module that temporarily switches off cropping (like crop itself but also retouch and liquify) would cause the shown image to move to a completely different area. This is no longer the case, although the image may still be slightly repositioned to move it to center.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR was a hellish journey again. To help understand what was needed to be changed and possibly predict/understand some side effects, I'll give a bit of background, also serving maybe as some kind of \"documentation\" when further changes are considered. Such documentation is completely lacking at the moment as far as I can tell and otherwise probably would not really reflect the actual current implementation and behavior anyway, so might have been worse than the nothing we have.\r\n\r\nIn the darkroom we have a multitude of coordinate systems to describe a spot in the image:\r\n1. relative position in terms of the \"complete\" image (the one shown in miniature in the top-left navigator window. This goes from horizontal 0-100% (left-right) and vertical 0-100% (top-bottom).\r\n2. same, but in pixels 0-720 horizontal 0-350 vertical (or a portion of this based on aspect ratio).\r\n3. actually, the buffer defined in 2. is only partially used if `preview_downsampling` is set to 1/2, 1/3 or 1/4.\r\n4. pixel position within the full calculated image based on applied crops/framing/rotation etc. This could be, say 0-3k horizontal and 0-2k vertical for a 24mpixel image that is cropped 50% in both directions.\r\n5. position within the central area of the darkroom. On an FHD monitor, full screen and with all panels hidden, this would be 0-1920 and 0-1080. This still includes a narrow border around the image (set in prefs) and a big white+black border if color calibration mode is switched on.\r\n6. relative position within the currently shown (zoomed) image in the central area of the darkroom (0-100% both).\r\n7. same, but in pixels. This is 5 minus the borders.\r\n8. - 10. same as 5-7 but for the second preview window.\r\n11. corresponding position of any of the previous points in terms of the original raw file. In 0-100%. The 50% crop in 4. could for example be 50-100% and 25-75%, if the right half of the image positioned centrally vertically was used.\r\n12. same in pixels; 3k-6k and 1k-3k for the example above.\r\n\r\nThese coordinate system are used while redrawing the screen and processing mouse moves and clicks and when dealing with visual elements like mask shapes, color picker areas and crop or perspective handles etc etc. Variables names don't indicate what coordinate system an \"x\" or \"y\" lives in (or at least I haven't discovered the consistency and I haven't myself improved the situation I'm sure). In _most_ places, we somehow reference back to a position within the \"full\" (i.e. current crop) image, but scaled down, that is shown in the navigator window (2. i.e. not necessarily corrected for downsampling; this correction needed to be applied every time before anything was done with it, so _all_ the individual modules etc were dealing with downsampling over and over again).\r\n\r\nWe have \"current positions\" for the center screen and the second preview window and the last calculated zoomed in \"preview\" for each of these, which may have been from a time that a crop was or wasn't active that currently isn't or is.\r\n\r\nBasically, this PR stores the current position and the positions of the calculated previews in coordinate system 12 (the context of the RAW file, which is immutable) and then when drawing positions them on the center and second preview areas based on current crop and zoom levels and locations.\r\n\r\nThat sounds trivial and to avoid introducing a lot of new bugs one obviously tries to be minimally invasive when making changes and reconnecting to existing code. But similar past changes introduced back and forth conversions everywhere to the extend that it really impossible to comprehend what is going on. So I had to try to create some order out of chaos. Again, starting with not making too big changes so that the impact could more easily be tested, but eventually in frustration, because it was impossible to get everything to line up, ending up completely ripping out _all_ the references to downsampling and instead at startup reducing the dimensions of the \"preview\" (navigator) miniature. This miraculously got rid of a lot of issues with no problems introduced as far as I could tell (please _do_ tell if you find any). Similarly, after calculating a preview image (full res) for the zoomed+cropped, the resoluting pixmap would be stored in a variable (with associated dimension variables) called \"backbuf\". For some reason, at some point a duplicate of these variables called \"output_backbuf\" was created and extensively used. Because the dimensions of the pixmap are somewhat related (after scaling) to the common \"standard\" of the full \"preview\" pixmap, the code ended up with references to `output_backbuf_width/height` everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe output buffers are only available once the calculations are finished (which doesn't happen at the same time for the preview/full/preview2 pipes) so their sizes and zoom levels get out of sync with the current zoom and crop. This PR tries to base the shown image on the actual current zoom and crop levels, but unfortunately can't convert RAW dimensions back and forth to the current zoomed-and-cropped screen image until a pipe has been refreshed based on the current history (which gets partly flushed whenever a module (un)focus happens) and might not get recreated soon if a long calculation is already underway. And many modules don't draw their visual elements anyway until the _preview_ is available...\r\n\r\nSo, yeah, this PR is not perfect. Further improvements will need work done on cache and possibly pipe handling. I may start an issue to discuss my thoughts there first, because I definitely want to tap into the knowledge of @TurboGit and @jenshannoschwalm  and possibly others who currently know more about those areas than I do, because the changes required would be somewhat extensive and gradual steps are not likely to be productive.\r\n\r\nThings you will notice when testing this PR:\r\n- snapshots and duplicates work, but if they are activated while the currently visible image has a wildly different size, crop or  orientation, they will be shown in an odd location.\r\n- slideshow is not connected up to the new approach at all yet; it doesn't work.\r\n- When rotating the image, the scaled preview and repositioned last calculated full view will be temporarily combined in an odd juxtaposition. It is probably necessary to determine and store the rotation (and flip) of a calculated image relative to the original raw when a pipe calculation finishes and the result is stored in the backbuf. We can then ask cairo to rotate+flip as an approximation or just temporarily hide the last full res image. Previously this wasn't an issue because we just continued showing the old image in the same location while the recalc was ongoing; we were not attempting to relocate/zoom to a predicted new location.\r\n\r\nPlease give this PR a go and tell me your thoughts; any specific cases that you feel might need special handling and are not getting it here. Any showstoppers that might make it practically infeasible to get this approach working correctly ever. Or just any questions the above has raised for you or that could be explained (much) better.\r\n\r\nEDIT: when testing changes like these, that are intended to make working with sets of heavy modules on slower machines (laptops lacking GPUs for example) bearable and on faster machines more fluid, it makes sense to test with some serious modules (d&s, blurs, liquify) enabled and possibly even switch off OpenCL.\r\n\r\nEDIT 2: This also fixes some memory leaks in snapshots and duplicates; pixmap bufs were allocated and filled and then cairo surfaces based on them. The surfaces were correctly destroyed afterwards, but since they didn't take ownership of the pixmaps, those still need to be `dt_free_align`ed as well.",

This has been done to make it possible to use some cropped region as source for Retouch for example. All fine.\r\n\r\nThe same behavior is done for the second window. I don't think this is necessary (we don't work on this view)  nor good.
