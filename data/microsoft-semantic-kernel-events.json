Currently, sk supports the nearest vector search.\r\n  3. What scenario does it contribute to? This PR supports hybrid search.\r\n  4. If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here. #3290 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your changes, the overall approach, the underlying design.\r\n     These notes will help understanding how your code works. Thanks! -->\r\n\r\nI added the \"search_type\" signature so that we're able to select the search type such as \"near_vector\" or \"hybrid\" which is weaviate's a feature\r\n.\r\n### Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Before submitting this PR, please make sure: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The code builds clean without any errors or warnings\r\n- [x] The PR follows the [SK Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [pre-submission formatting script](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-scripts) raises no violations\r\n- [x] All unit tests pass, and I have added new tests where possible\r\n- [ ] I didn't break anyone :smile:\r\n",

Currently, sk supports the nearest vector search.\r\n  3. What scenario does it contribute to? This PR supports hybrid search.\r\n  4. If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here. #3290 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your changes, the overall approach, the underlying design.\r\n     These notes will help understanding how your code works. Thanks! -->\r\n\r\nI added the \"search_type\" signature so that we're able to select the search type such as \"near_vector\" or \"hybrid\" which is weaviate's a feature\r\n.\r\n### Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Before submitting this PR, please make sure: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The code builds clean without any errors or warnings\r\n- [x] The PR follows the [SK Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [pre-submission formatting script](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-scripts) raises no violations\r\n- [x] All unit tests pass, and I have added new tests where possible\r\n- [ ] I didn't break anyone :smile:\r\n",
