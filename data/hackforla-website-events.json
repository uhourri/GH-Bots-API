Results will be categorized as misspellings or false positives in the HfLA spelling audit spreadsheet[^1] and will be resolved in later issues.  \r\n\r\n### Action Items\r\n- [ ] You must use VS Code as your local text editor and install the `Code Spell Checker` VS Code extension[^2]  \r\n- [ ] Do not change any configuration settings or make any spell corrections\r\n- [ ] Open the file '_includes/guide-card.html' and note any Code Spell Checker errors\r\n- [ ] Locate the file in column A (\"File\") of the \"Page Audit\" sheet. In the column labeled \"Result Summary\", select the appropriate option: `No errors` or `At least one error`.\r\n- [ ] If at least one error was reported, copy/paste each cSpell message into a separate row in the `Results` sheet\r\n- [ ] In each new row, select the appropriate value: `misspelling` or `false positive` from the \"Result type\" column. A false positive is a term that is not a misspelling but is not recognized by the spell checker because it is a technical term, abbreviation, acronym, URL or proper noun (name of a person, place or organization).\r\n- [ ] Move this issue to the Questions/In Review column and apply the label `ready for dev lead`\r\n\r\n### Merge Team\r\n- [ ] After this issue is closed, release the dependency on this issue in #5248\r\n- [ ] After the last dependency has been released, close that issue\r\n\r\n### Resources/Instructions\r\n- This issue is part of #5248\r\n[^1]: [HfLA spelling audit spreadsheet - Results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c2C9zUF_LsLGrnJN_LAlPV4UObz-nYffJyOiB_M6oI0/edit#gid=69989048)\r\n[^2]: The recommended installation method is to install Code Spell Checker directly from the VS Code text editor, and those instructions can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/get-started/extensions). The extension can also be installed via the VS Code Marketplace website [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker).\r\n",

Then, you can check this off.\r\nProgress through issues in the [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7#column-7198257) only with increasing complexity in the following order:\r\n  - Good first issue (two per person)\r\n  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)\r\n  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time)\r\n  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)\r\n    - The reasons for this progression are:\r\n      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.\r\n      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.\r\n      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.\r\n    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:\r\n      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity\r\n      - Special request by a lead or pm\r\n- [ ] Read the [Start Here - Developers](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8583%3A0) in Figma\r\n- [ ] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their SCSS classes)\r\n- [ ] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.\r\n\r\n### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?\r\n- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.\r\n- Then, add the label \"Status: Help Wanted\" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.\r\n- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.\r\n- Lastly, you can add the issue to the \"Development team meeting discussion items\" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting. Please bring it during the meeting that you need help.\r\n\r\n### Resources/Instructions\r\n- [Contributing.md - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Front End](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+front+end%22)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Back End/DevOps](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+back+end%2Fdevops%22)\r\n- [Figma - Hack for LA](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website)\r\n- [Google Drive - Hack for LA website team](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p76K0FgfiAWeIIEyoyJ_Iik8FVj8cBjT?usp=sharing)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - Dev Team Tuesday meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2010)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - All Team meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2027)\r\n- [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests)\r\n",

Also, once you finish providing your \"Estimate\" action item below, please answer the question in the \"Time spent so far\" action item (also below).\r\n   - [ ] Estimate: Copy the below and put it in the \"good first issue\" that you picked.\r\n Check this box when you have completed this task so that we can identify if you understood the instructions and know what to do on all subsequent issues upon assignment. (Note: Please provide estimates on all the issues that you pick up, going forward.)\r\n    ```\r\n   Availability for this week:\r\n   My estimated ETA for completing this issue:\r\n    ```\r\n   - [ ] Time spent so far: Copy the question below into a new comment below (in this pre-work issue only) and answer it. This is just to get feedback on how long it took you to get to this point on this pre-work. There is no right or wrong answers. There is no judgement. It is ok if you take a long time or if you do it really fast or at any pace.\r\n    ```\r\n    How many hours did it take you to finish the pre-work up to and including adding your initial ETA and availability for your good first issue, including attending your first meetings?\r\n    ```\r\n   - [ ] Progress Reports: Copy the below and put it in the issue once you have been assigned to the issue at least 5 days (we check weekly on Fridays), or sooner if you have something to report.  If you finish this issue before 5 days are reached, Yeah!!, do it on your next issue. **This update should be done every week for every issue that you are assigned to**. The checkbox here is meant for us to see if you understood the instructions when you end up doing your first weekly progress update.\r\n    ```\r\n    Provide Update\r\n    1. Progress\r\n    2. Blockers\r\n    3. Availability\r\n    4.

The [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests) guide will teach you how to review pull requests.\r\n   - [ ] Please work on only one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before picking up another issue.\r\n- [ ] Read and understand how we progress through issues. Then, you can check this off.\r\nProgress through issues in the [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7#column-7198257) only with increasing complexity in the following order:\r\n  - Good first issue (two per person)\r\n  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)\r\n  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time)\r\n  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)\r\n    - The reasons for this progression are:\r\n      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.\r\n      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.\r\n      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.\r\n    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:\r\n      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity\r\n      - Special request by a lead or pm\r\n- [ ] Read the [Start Here - Developers](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8583%3A0) in Figma\r\n- [ ] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their SCSS classes)\r\n- [ ] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.\r\n\r\n### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?\r\n- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.\r\n- Then, add the label \"Status: Help Wanted\" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.\r\n- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.\r\n- Lastly, you can add the issue to the \"Development team meeting discussion items\" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting. Please bring it during the meeting that you need help.\r\n\r\n### Resources/Instructions\r\n- [Contributing.md - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Front End](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+front+end%22)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Back End/DevOps](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+back+end%2Fdevops%22)\r\n- [Figma - Hack for LA](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website)\r\n- [Google Drive - Hack for LA website team](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p76K0FgfiAWeIIEyoyJ_Iik8FVj8cBjT?usp=sharing)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - Dev Team Tuesday meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2010)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - All Team meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2027)\r\n- [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests)\r\n",

Please make sure to attend the general Hack for LA onboarding to get the process started https://meetup.com/hackforla/events. \r\n\r\n### Overview \r\nAs a new developer on the HfLA website team, fill in the following fields as you complete each onboarding item. \r\n\r\n### Special Notes \r\n1. It may take you a few weeks to finish this issue, because part of it is learning how to provide updates on issues that take more than a week to complete.    Please keep this issue open until you have been able to do all the steps.  \r\n2.

The [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests) guide will teach you how to review pull requests.\r\n   - [x] Please work on only one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before picking up another issue.\r\n- [x] Read and understand how we progress through issues. Then, you can check this off.\r\nProgress through issues in the [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7#column-7198257) only with increasing complexity in the following order:\r\n  - Good first issue (one per person)\r\n  - Good second issue (one per person)\r\n  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)\r\n  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time)\r\n  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)\r\n    - The reasons for this progression are:\r\n      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.\r\n      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.\r\n      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.\r\n    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:\r\n      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity\r\n      - Special request by a lead or pm\r\n- [x] Read the [Start Here - Developers](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8583%3A0) in Figma\r\n- [x] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their SCSS classes)\r\n- [x] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.\r\n\r\n### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?\r\n- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.\r\n- Then, add the label \"Status: Help Wanted\" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.\r\n- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.\r\n- Lastly, you can add the issue to the \"Development team meeting discussion items\" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting. Please bring it during the meeting that you need help.\r\n\r\n### Resources/Instructions\r\n- [Contributing.md - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Front End](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+front+end%22)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Back End/DevOps](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+back+end%2Fdevops%22)\r\n- [Figma - Hack for LA](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website)\r\n- [Google Drive - Hack for LA website team](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p76K0FgfiAWeIIEyoyJ_Iik8FVj8cBjT?usp=sharing)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - Dev Team Tuesday meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2010)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - All Team meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2027)\r\n- [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests)\r\n",

Results will be categorized as misspellings or false positives in the HfLA spelling audit spreadsheet[^1] and will be resolved in later issues.  \r\n\r\n### Action Items\r\n- [ ] You must use VS Code as your local text editor and install the `Code Spell Checker` VS Code extension[^2]  \r\n- [ ] Do not change any configuration settings or make any spell corrections\r\n- [ ] Open the file '_includes/guide-card.html' and note any Code Spell Checker errors\r\n- [ ] Locate the file in column A (\"File\") of the \"Page Audit\" sheet. In the column labeled \"Result Summary\", select the appropriate option: `No errors` or `At least one error`.\r\n- [ ] If at least one error was reported, copy/paste each cSpell message into a separate row in the `Results` sheet\r\n- [ ] In each new row, select the appropriate value: `misspelling` or `false positive` from the \"Result type\" column. A false positive is a term that is not a misspelling but is not recognized by the spell checker because it is a technical term, abbreviation, acronym, URL or proper noun (name of a person, place or organization).\r\n- [ ] Move this issue to the Questions/In Review column and apply the label `ready for dev lead`\r\n\r\n### Merge Team\r\n- [ ] After this issue is closed, release the dependency on this issue in #5248\r\n- [ ] After the last dependency has been released, close that issue\r\n\r\n### Resources/Instructions\r\n- This issue is part of #5248\r\n[^1]: [HfLA spelling audit spreadsheet - Results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c2C9zUF_LsLGrnJN_LAlPV4UObz-nYffJyOiB_M6oI0/edit#gid=69989048)\r\n[^2]: The recommended installation method is to install Code Spell Checker directly from the VS Code text editor, and those instructions can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/get-started/extensions). The extension can also be installed via the VS Code Marketplace website [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker).\r\n",

I see that you didn't pick up any issues after joining the Hack for LA website team.  We are going to go ahead and close this issue. \r\n\r\nIf you want to return, you can reopen this issue or write to us in the #hfla-site Slack channel\r\n```\r\n- [ ] Everythings fine, they just haven't been assigned anything long enough to have done an in progress update\r\n```\r\nI am reopening this issue until you have been assigned to a development issue long enough to make an in progress update.  It can will stay open until you get an issue that takes longer than a week to complete (likely a medium or large size issue).  That way, we know you can make detailed progress updates.  In the meantime, if you get reminders to update this issue, just let us know what size and number issue you are assigned to at the time.  That way, we have a record (in one place) of your progress.\r\n```\r\n\r\n- [ ] no issue assigned after second issue\r\n```\r\nI see you finished your good first issue and second issue but have not yet picked up a small issue.  Here are the issues that are available that match the role labels you choose on your prework\r\n[Front End, Small](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22complexity%3A+small%22+label%3A%22role%3A+front+end%22#column-7198257) | [Back End, Small](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22complexity%3A+small%22+label%3A%22role%3A+back+end%2Fdevops%22#column-7198257)\r\n```\r\n- [ ] prework successfully completed\r\n```\r\n- Has provided two progress updates in this issue [ADD ISSUE LINK]\r\n\r\nThis prework has been successfully completed!\r\n```\r\n\r\n- [ ] They have not picked up a good second issue\r\n```\r\nI noticed that you have not picked up a second issue.  It's possible when you looked for one, there was not one available.  \r\n\r\nThere is 1 available now [Good front end](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+front+end%22+label%3A%22role%3A+back+end%2Fdevops%22+label%3A%22complexity%3A+good+second+issue%22#column-7198257).  \r\n\r\nIf you don't find one when you look again, go ahead and do another [good first issue](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+label%3A%22role%3A+front+end%22+label%3A%22role%3A+back+end%2Fdevops%22#column-7198257).  They are basically the same type of issue, we just need people to do two total so that we can make sure you dev environment is setup and you know how to do branching effectively.\r\n```\r\n",

Then, you can check this off.\r\nProgress through issues in the [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7#column-7198257) only with increasing complexity in the following order:\r\n  - Good first issue (two per person)\r\n  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)\r\n  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time)\r\n  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)\r\n    - The reasons for this progression are:\r\n      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.\r\n      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.\r\n      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.\r\n    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:\r\n      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity\r\n      - Special request by a lead or pm\r\n- [x] Read the [Start Here - Developers](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8583%3A0) in Figma\r\n- [ ] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their SCSS classes)\r\n- [ ] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.\r\n\r\n### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?\r\n- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.\r\n- Then, add the label \"Status: Help Wanted\" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.\r\n- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.\r\n- Lastly, you can add the issue to the \"Development team meeting discussion items\" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting. Please bring it during the meeting that you need help.\r\n\r\n### Resources/Instructions\r\n- [Contributing.md - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Front End](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+front+end%22)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Back End/DevOps](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+back+end%2Fdevops%22)\r\n- [Figma - Hack for LA](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website)\r\n- [Google Drive - Hack for LA website team](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p76K0FgfiAWeIIEyoyJ_Iik8FVj8cBjT?usp=sharing)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - Dev Team Tuesday meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2010)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - All Team meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2027)\r\n- [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests)\r\n",

That way we can help you resolve any set up issues immediately.\r\n- [x] Read section 2.1 - 2.4 in [Part 2: How the Website team works with GitHub issues within Contributing.md](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md#part-2-how-the-website-team-works-with-github-issues)\r\n  - [ ] Follow the steps in section [2.3 Where can I find GitHub issues to work on?](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md#23-where-can-i-find-github-issues-to-work-on) to assign yourself your first issue under the Project Board's Prioritized Backlog column and use [2.7 Working on a Issue within Contributing.md](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md#27-working-on-an-issue) to start working on your issue\r\n  - [ ] Read [2.6 What to do when you need to stop mid issue](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md#26-what-to-do-when-you-need-to-stop-mid-issue)\r\n- [ ] Once you take a good first issue, you will provide estimates and progress reports. Also, once you finish providing your \"Estimate\" action item below, please answer the question in the \"Time spent so far\" action item (also below).\r\n   - [ ] Estimate: Copy the below and put it in the \"good first issue\" that you picked.\r\n Check this box when you have completed this task so that we can identify if you understood the instructions and know what to do on all subsequent issues upon assignment. (Note: Please provide estimates on all the issues that you pick up, going forward.)\r\n    ```\r\n   Availability for this week:\r\n   My estimated ETA for completing this issue:\r\n    ```\r\n   - [ ] Time spent so far: Copy the question below into a new comment below (in this pre-work issue only) and answer it. This is just to get feedback on how long it took you to get to this point on this pre-work. There is no right or wrong answers. There is no judgement. It is ok if you take a long time or if you do it really fast or at any pace.\r\n    ```\r\n    How many hours did it take you to finish the pre-work up to and including adding your initial ETA and availability for your good first issue, including attending your first meetings?\r\n    ```\r\n   - [ ] Progress Reports: Copy the below and put it in the issue once you have been assigned to the issue at least 5 days (we check weekly on Fridays), or sooner if you have something to report.  If you finish this issue before 5 days are reached, Yeah!!, do it on your next issue. **This update should be done every week for every issue that you are assigned to**. The checkbox here is meant for us to see if you understood the instructions when you end up doing your first weekly progress update.\r\n    ```\r\n    Provide Update\r\n    1. Progress\r\n    2. Blockers\r\n    3. Availability\r\n    4. ETA\r\n    ```\r\n- [ ] Read sections 3.1.a - 3.1.c in [3.1 How to make a pull request](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/2e3c45fede99e61f479548ccca3f0dda83e351db/CONTRIBUTING.md#31-how-to-make-a-pull-request) to learn more about how to make a pull request (PR) for the issue that you are working on and how to make changes to your PR if changes are requested by the reviewer\r\n- [ ] Additional notes:\r\n   - [ ] Please don't forget to review pull requests whenever you are able to.  The [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests) guide will teach you how to review pull requests.\r\n   - [ ] Please work on only one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before picking up another issue.\r\n- [ ] Read and understand how we progress through issues. Then, you can check this off.\r\nProgress through issues in the [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7#column-7198257) only with increasing complexity in the following order:\r\n  - Good first issue (two per person)\r\n  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)\r\n  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time)\r\n  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)\r\n    - The reasons for this progression are:\r\n      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.\r\n      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.\r\n      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.\r\n    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:\r\n      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity\r\n      - Special request by a lead or pm\r\n- [ ] Read the [Start Here - Developers](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8583%3A0) in Figma\r\n- [ ] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their SCSS classes)\r\n- [ ] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.\r\n\r\n### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?\r\n- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.\r\n- Then, add the label \"Status: Help Wanted\" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.\r\n- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.\r\n- Lastly, you can add the issue to the \"Development team meeting discussion items\" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting. Please bring it during the meeting that you need help.\r\n\r\n### Resources/Instructions\r\n- [Contributing.md - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Front End](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+front+end%22)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Back End/DevOps](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+back+end%2Fdevops%22)\r\n- [Figma - Hack for LA](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website)\r\n- [Google Drive - Hack for LA website team](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p76K0FgfiAWeIIEyoyJ_Iik8FVj8cBjT?usp=sharing)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - Dev Team Tuesday meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2010)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - All Team meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2027)\r\n- [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests)\r\n",

The [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests) guide will teach you how to review pull requests.\r\n   - [ ] Please work on only one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before picking up another issue.\r\n- [ ] Read and understand how we progress through issues. Then, you can check this off.\r\nProgress through issues in the [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7#column-7198257) only with increasing complexity in the following order:\r\n  - Good first issue (two per person)\r\n  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)\r\n  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time)\r\n  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)\r\n    - The reasons for this progression are:\r\n      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.\r\n      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.\r\n      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.\r\n    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:\r\n      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity\r\n      - Special request by a lead or pm\r\n- [ ] Read the [Start Here - Developers](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8583%3A0) in Figma\r\n- [ ] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their SCSS classes)\r\n- [ ] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.\r\n\r\n### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?\r\n- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.\r\n- Then, add the label \"Status: Help Wanted\" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.\r\n- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.\r\n- Lastly, you can add the issue to the \"Development team meeting discussion items\" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting. Please bring it during the meeting that you need help.\r\n\r\n### Resources/Instructions\r\n- [Contributing.md - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Front End](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+front+end%22)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Back End/DevOps](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+back+end%2Fdevops%22)\r\n- [Figma - Hack for LA](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website)\r\n- [Google Drive - Hack for LA website team](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p76K0FgfiAWeIIEyoyJ_Iik8FVj8cBjT?usp=sharing)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - Dev Team Tuesday meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2010)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - All Team meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2027)\r\n- [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests)\r\n",

The first two issues is where we catch if anyone has problems with branching appropriately on our project.  So we intentionly make them very very small and perscriptive so that we can focus on making sure you have the branching down before we move you on to the bigger issues that get less and less perscriptive as you go up the ladder.\r\n\r\nWhen you sucessfully finish with this issue/PR, you can go on to a Small issue just as you would have before.\r\n```\r\n- [HfLA Site Audit: Good Second Issue Label](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xoCOAxoUXo2kVNeaQAwUgfqlNU0RiLGcHrY6sAGqhfc/edit#gid=0)",

The [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests) guide will teach you how to review pull requests.\r\n   - [ ] Please work on only one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before picking up another issue.\r\n- [ ] Read and understand how we progress through issues. Then, you can check this off.\r\nProgress through issues in the [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7#column-7198257) only with increasing complexity in the following order:\r\n  - Good first issue (one per person)\r\n  - Good second issue (one per person)\r\n  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)\r\n  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time)\r\n  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)\r\n    - The reasons for this progression are:\r\n      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.\r\n      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.\r\n      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.\r\n    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:\r\n      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity\r\n      - Special request by a lead or pm\r\n- [ ] Read the [Start Here - Developers](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8583%3A0) in Figma\r\n- [ ] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their SCSS classes)\r\n- [ ] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.\r\n\r\n### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?\r\n- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.\r\n- Then, add the label \"Status: Help Wanted\" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.\r\n- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.\r\n- Lastly, you can add the issue to the \"Development team meeting discussion items\" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting. Please bring it during the meeting that you need help.\r\n\r\n### Resources/Instructions\r\n- [Contributing.md - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Front End](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+front+end%22)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Back End/DevOps](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+back+end%2Fdevops%22)\r\n- [Figma - Hack for LA](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website)\r\n- [Google Drive - Hack for LA website team](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p76K0FgfiAWeIIEyoyJ_Iik8FVj8cBjT?usp=sharing)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - Dev Team Tuesday meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2010)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - All Team meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2027)\r\n- [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests)\r\n",

The [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests) guide will teach you how to review pull requests.\r\n   - [x] Please work on only one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before picking up another issue.\r\n- [ ] Read and understand how we progress through issues. Then, you can check this off.\r\nProgress through issues in the [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7#column-7198257) only with increasing complexity in the following order:\r\n  - Good first issue (one per person)\r\n  - Good second issue (one per person)\r\n  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)\r\n  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time)\r\n  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)\r\n    - The reasons for this progression are:\r\n      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.\r\n      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.\r\n      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.\r\n    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:\r\n      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity\r\n      - Special request by a lead or pm\r\n- [x] Read the [Start Here - Developers](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8583%3A0) in Figma\r\n- [x] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their SCSS classes)\r\n- [ ] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.\r\n\r\n### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?\r\n- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.\r\n- Then, add the label \"Status: Help Wanted\" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.\r\n- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.\r\n- Lastly, you can add the issue to the \"Development team meeting discussion items\" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting. Please bring it during the meeting that you need help.\r\n\r\n### Resources/Instructions\r\n- [Contributing.md - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Front End](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+front+end%22)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Back End/DevOps](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+back+end%2Fdevops%22)\r\n- [Figma - Hack for LA](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website)\r\n- [Google Drive - Hack for LA website team](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p76K0FgfiAWeIIEyoyJ_Iik8FVj8cBjT?usp=sharing)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - Dev Team Tuesday meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2010)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - All Team meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2027)\r\n- [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests)\r\n",

The [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests) guide will teach you how to review pull requests.\r\n   - [x] Please work on only one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before picking up another issue.\r\n- [ ] Read and understand how we progress through issues. Then, you can check this off.\r\nProgress through issues in the [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7#column-7198257) only with increasing complexity in the following order:\r\n  - Good first issue (one per person)\r\n  - Good second issue (one per person)\r\n  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)\r\n  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time)\r\n  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)\r\n    - The reasons for this progression are:\r\n      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.\r\n      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.\r\n      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.\r\n    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:\r\n      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity\r\n      - Special request by a lead or pm\r\n- [ ] Read the [Start Here - Developers](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8583%3A0) in Figma\r\n- [ ] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their SCSS classes)\r\n- [ ] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.\r\n\r\n### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?\r\n- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.\r\n- Then, add the label \"Status: Help Wanted\" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.\r\n- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.\r\n- Lastly, you can add the issue to the \"Development team meeting discussion items\" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting. Please bring it during the meeting that you need help.\r\n\r\n### Resources/Instructions\r\n- [Contributing.md - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Front End](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+front+end%22)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Back End/DevOps](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+back+end%2Fdevops%22)\r\n- [Figma - Hack for LA](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website)\r\n- [Google Drive - Hack for LA website team](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p76K0FgfiAWeIIEyoyJ_Iik8FVj8cBjT?usp=sharing)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - Dev Team Tuesday meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2010)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - All Team meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2027)\r\n- [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests)\r\n",

Also, once you finish providing your \"Estimate\" action item below, please answer the question in the \"Time spent so far\" action item (also below).\r\n   - [ ] Estimate: Copy the below and put it in the \"good first issue\" that you picked.\r\n Check this box when you have completed this task so that we can identify if you understood the instructions and know what to do on all subsequent issues upon assignment. (Note: Please provide estimates on all the issues that you pick up, going forward.)\r\n    ```\r\n   Availability for this week:\r\n   My estimated ETA for completing this issue:\r\n    ```\r\n   - [ ] Time spent so far: Copy the question below into a new comment below (in this pre-work issue only) and answer it. This is just to get feedback on how long it took you to get to this point on this pre-work. There is no right or wrong answers. There is no judgement. It is ok if you take a long time or if you do it really fast or at any pace.\r\n    ```\r\n    How many hours did it take you to finish the pre-work up to and including adding your initial ETA and availability for your good first issue, including attending your first meetings?\r\n    ```\r\n   - [ ] Progress Reports: Copy the below and put it in the issue once you have been assigned to the issue at least 5 days (we check weekly on Fridays), or sooner if you have something to report.  If you finish this issue before 5 days are reached, Yeah!!, do it on your next issue. **This update should be done every week for every issue that you are assigned to**. The checkbox here is meant for us to see if you understood the instructions when you end up doing your first weekly progress update.\r\n    ```\r\n    Provide Update\r\n    1. Progress\r\n    2. Blockers\r\n    3. Availability\r\n    4. ETA\r\n    ```\r\n- [ ] Read sections 3.1.a - 3.1.c in [3.1 How to make a pull request](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/2e3c45fede99e61f479548ccca3f0dda83e351db/CONTRIBUTING.md#31-how-to-make-a-pull-request) to learn more about how to make a pull request (PR) for the issue that you are working on and how to make changes to your PR if changes are requested by the reviewer\r\n- [ ] Additional notes:\r\n   - [ ] Please don't forget to review pull requests whenever you are able to.  The [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests) guide will teach you how to review pull requests.\r\n   - [ ] Please work on only one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before picking up another issue.\r\n- [ ] Read and understand how we progress through issues. Then, you can check this off.\r\nProgress through issues in the [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7#column-7198257) only with increasing complexity in the following order:\r\n  - Good first issue (one per person)\r\n  - Good second issue (one per person)\r\n  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)\r\n  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time)\r\n  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)\r\n    - The reasons for this progression are:\r\n      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.\r\n      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.\r\n      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.\r\n    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:\r\n      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity\r\n      - Special request by a lead or pm\r\n- [ ] Read the [Start Here - Developers](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8583%3A0) in Figma\r\n- [ ] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their SCSS classes)\r\n- [ ] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.\r\n\r\n### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?\r\n- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.\r\n- Then, add the label \"Status: Help Wanted\" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.\r\n- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.\r\n- Lastly, you can add the issue to the \"Development team meeting discussion items\" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting. Please bring it during the meeting that you need help.\r\n\r\n### Resources/Instructions\r\n- [Contributing.md - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Front End](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+front+end%22)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Back End/DevOps](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+back+end%2Fdevops%22)\r\n- [Figma - Hack for LA](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website)\r\n- [Google Drive - Hack for LA website team](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p76K0FgfiAWeIIEyoyJ_Iik8FVj8cBjT?usp=sharing)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - Dev Team Tuesday meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2010)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - All Team meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2027)\r\n- [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests)\r\n",

The [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests) guide will teach you how to review pull requests.\r\n   - [x] Please work on only one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before picking up another issue.\r\n- [x] Read and understand how we progress through issues. Then, you can check this off.\r\nProgress through issues in the [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7#column-7198257) only with increasing complexity in the following order:\r\n  - Good first issue (one per person)\r\n  - Good second issue (one per person)\r\n  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)\r\n  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time)\r\n  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)\r\n    - The reasons for this progression are:\r\n      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.\r\n      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.\r\n      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.\r\n    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:\r\n      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity\r\n      - Special request by a lead or pm\r\n- [x] Read the [Start Here - Developers](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8583%3A0) in Figma\r\n- [x] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their SCSS classes)\r\n- [x] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.\r\n\r\n### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?\r\n- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.\r\n- Then, add the label \"Status: Help Wanted\" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.\r\n- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.\r\n- Lastly, you can add the issue to the \"Development team meeting discussion items\" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting. Please bring it during the meeting that you need help.\r\n\r\n### Resources/Instructions\r\n- [Contributing.md - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Front End](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+front+end%22)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Back End/DevOps](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+back+end%2Fdevops%22)\r\n- [Figma - Hack for LA](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website)\r\n- [Google Drive - Hack for LA website team](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p76K0FgfiAWeIIEyoyJ_Iik8FVj8cBjT?usp=sharing)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - Dev Team Tuesday meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2010)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - All Team meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2027)\r\n- [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests)\r\n",

If you finish this issue before 5 days are reached, Yeah!!, do it on your next issue. **This update should be done every week for every issue that you are assigned to**.

The [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests) guide will teach you how to review pull requests.\r\n   - [x] Please work on only one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before picking up another issue.\r\n- [x] Read and understand how we progress through issues. Then, you can check this off.\r\nProgress through issues in the [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7#column-7198257) only with increasing complexity in the following order:\r\n  - Good first issue (one per person)\r\n  - Good second issue (one per person)\r\n  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)\r\n  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time)\r\n  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)\r\n    - The reasons for this progression are:\r\n      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.\r\n      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.\r\n      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.\r\n    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:\r\n      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity\r\n      - Special request by a lead or pm\r\n- [x] Read the [Start Here - Developers](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8583%3A0) in Figma\r\n- [x] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their SCSS classes)\r\n- [x] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.\r\n\r\n### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?\r\n- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.\r\n- Then, add the label \"Status: Help Wanted\" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.\r\n- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.\r\n- Lastly, you can add the issue to the \"Development team meeting discussion items\" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting. Please bring it during the meeting that you need help.\r\n\r\n### Resources/Instructions\r\n- [Contributing.md - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Front End](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+front+end%22)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Back End/DevOps](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+back+end%2Fdevops%22)\r\n- [Figma - Hack for LA](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website)\r\n- [Google Drive - Hack for LA website team](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p76K0FgfiAWeIIEyoyJ_Iik8FVj8cBjT?usp=sharing)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - Dev Team Tuesday meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2010)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - All Team meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2027)\r\n- [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests)\r\n",

It may take you a few weeks to finish this issue, because part of it is learning how to provide updates on issues that take more than a week to complete.    Please keep this issue open until you have been able to do all the steps.  \r\n2.

The [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests) guide will teach you how to review pull requests.\r\n   - [ ] Please work on only one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before picking up another issue.\r\n- [ ] Read and understand how we progress through issues. Then, you can check this off.\r\nProgress through issues in the [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7#column-7198257) only with increasing complexity in the following order:\r\n  - Good first issue (one per person)\r\n  - Good second issue (one per person)\r\n  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)\r\n  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time)\r\n  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)\r\n    - The reasons for this progression are:\r\n      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.\r\n      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.\r\n      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.\r\n    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:\r\n      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity\r\n      - Special request by a lead or pm\r\n- [ ] Read the [Start Here - Developers](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8583%3A0) in Figma\r\n- [ ] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their SCSS classes)\r\n- [ ] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.\r\n\r\n### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?\r\n- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.\r\n- Then, add the label \"Status: Help Wanted\" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.\r\n- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.\r\n- Lastly, you can add the issue to the \"Development team meeting discussion items\" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting. Please bring it during the meeting that you need help.\r\n\r\n### Resources/Instructions\r\n- [Contributing.md - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Front End](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+front+end%22)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Back End/DevOps](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+back+end%2Fdevops%22)\r\n- [Figma - Hack for LA](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website)\r\n- [Google Drive - Hack for LA website team](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p76K0FgfiAWeIIEyoyJ_Iik8FVj8cBjT?usp=sharing)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - Dev Team Tuesday meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2010)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - All Team meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2027)\r\n- [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests)\r\n",

The [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests) guide will teach you how to review pull requests.\r\n   - [ ] Please work on only one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before picking up another issue.\r\n- [ ] Read and understand how we progress through issues. Then, you can check this off.\r\nProgress through issues in the [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7#column-7198257) only with increasing complexity in the following order:\r\n  - Good first issue (one per person)\r\n  - Another good first issue (one per person)\r\n  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)\r\n  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time, max two or three)\r\n  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)\r\n    - The reasons for this progression are:\r\n      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.\r\n      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.\r\n      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.\r\n    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:\r\n      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity\r\n      - Special request by a lead or pm\r\n- [ ] Read the [Start Here - Developers](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8583%3A0) in Figma\r\n- [ ] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their SCSS classes)\r\n- [ ] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.\r\n\r\n### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?\r\n- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.\r\n- Then, add the label \"Status: Help Wanted\" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.\r\n- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.\r\n- Lastly, you can add the issue to the \"Development team meeting discussion items\" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting.

It is ok if you take a long time or if you do it really fast or at any pace.\r\n    ```\r\n    How many hours did it take you to finish the pre-work up to and including adding your initial ETA and availability for your good first issue, including attending your first meetings?\r\n    ```\r\n   - [ ] Progress Reports: Copy the below and put it in the issue once you have been assigned to the issue at least 5 days (we check weekly on Fridays), or sooner if you have something to report.  If you finish this issue before 5 days are reached, Yeah!!, do it on your next issue. **This update should be done every week for every issue that you are assigned to**. The checkbox here is meant for us to see if you understood the instructions when you end up doing your first weekly progress update.\r\n    ```\r\n    Provide Update\r\n    1. Progress\r\n    2. Blockers\r\n    3. Availability\r\n    4.

The [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests) guide will teach you how to review pull requests.\r\n   - [x] Please work on only one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before picking up another issue.\r\n- [ ] Read and understand how we progress through issues. Then, you can check this off.\r\nProgress through issues in the [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7#column-7198257) only with increasing complexity in the following order:\r\n  - Good first issue (one per person)\r\n  - Good second issue (one per person)\r\n  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)\r\n  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time)\r\n  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)\r\n    - The reasons for this progression are:\r\n      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.\r\n      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.\r\n      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.\r\n    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:\r\n      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity\r\n      - Special request by a lead or pm\r\n- [ ] Read the [Start Here - Developers](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8583%3A0) in Figma\r\n- [ ] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their SCSS classes)\r\n- [ ] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.\r\n\r\n### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?\r\n- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.\r\n- Then, add the label \"Status: Help Wanted\" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.\r\n- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.\r\n- Lastly, you can add the issue to the \"Development team meeting discussion items\" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting. Please bring it during the meeting that you need help.\r\n\r\n### Resources/Instructions\r\n- [Contributing.md - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Front End](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+front+end%22)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Back End/DevOps](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+back+end%2Fdevops%22)\r\n- [Figma - Hack for LA](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website)\r\n- [Google Drive - Hack for LA website team](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p76K0FgfiAWeIIEyoyJ_Iik8FVj8cBjT?usp=sharing)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - Dev Team Tuesday meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2010)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - All Team meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2027)\r\n- [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests)\r\n",

We want to make these functions reusable within the codebase so they are not being defined multiple times for the same function across different files.\r\n\r\n### Action Items\r\n- [ ] Look through the [github-actions](https://github.com/hackforla/website/tree/gh-pages/github-actions) folder and find all instances of a function that is defined more than once\r\n  - [ ] e.g. getTimeline(issueNum) is defined in add-label.js _and_ preliminary-update-comment.js\r\n  - [ ] Take note of any functions that have the same name, but different sets of parameters\r\n- [ ] Define all reusable functions within the github-actions/utils folder so they can be called in other files without redefining them\r\n- [ ] Test in your local repo that this does not break any existing GHAs \r\n\r\n### Resources/Instructions\r\n- [Github Actions](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/Hack-for-LA's-GitHub-Actions)\r\n",

It may take you a few weeks to finish this issue, because part of it is learning how to provide updates on issues that take more than a week to complete.    Please keep this issue open until you have been able to do all the steps.  \r\n2.

The [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests) guide will teach you how to review pull requests.\r\n   - [x] Please work on only one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before picking up another issue.\r\n- [x] Read and understand how we progress through issues. Then, you can check this off.\r\nProgress through issues with increasing complexity in the following order:\r\n  - Good first issue (one per person)\r\n  - Good second issue (one per person)\r\n  - Small (one per person, with some exceptions, see below)\r\n  - Medium (you can work on more than one medium issue, but only one at a time)\r\n  - Large (you can work on more than one large issue, but only one at a time)\r\n    - The reasons for this progression are:\r\n      - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.\r\n      - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.\r\n      - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.\r\n    - You can work on back-to-back small issues if it meets the following criteria:\r\n      - You are learning something new and need to work on an issue of a lesser complexity\r\n      - Special request by a lead or pm\r\n- [x] Read the [Start Here - Developers](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=8583%3A0) in Figma\r\n- [x] Go familiarize yourself with the [Hack for LA Design System page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website?node-id=3464%3A3)  (where you can see components and their SCSS classes)\r\n- [x] Once all tasks are completed, close this issue.  This issue will remain open until you get through your first progress report.  Once you have done that, we are confident you know how to keep the momentum going on your issue and keep your team informed.\r\n\r\n### What should I do if I have a question about an issue I'm working on, and I haven't gotten a response yet?\r\n- First, you should post the question or blocker as a comment on your assigned issue, so it can be easily referred to in the next bullet points.\r\n- Then, add the label \"Status: Help Wanted\" so other developers can see it and potentially help answer your question. In addition, you will still need to post a Slack message or bring it up in meeting so we know you need help; see below for how to do that.\r\n- Also, you can post your question on the hfla-site slack channel and link the issue you're working on, so other developers can see and respond.\r\n- Lastly, you can add the issue to the \"Development team meeting discussion items\" column of the Project Board so that it can be addressed in the next development meeting. Please bring it during the meeting that you need help.\r\n\r\n### Resources/Instructions\r\n- [Contributing.md - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board - Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Front End](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+front+end%22)\r\n- [GitHub Project Board Prioritized Backlog highlighted and sorted by Back End/DevOps](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7?card_filter_query=label%3A%22role%3A+back+end%2Fdevops%22)\r\n- [Figma - Hack for LA](https://www.figma.com/file/0RRPy1Ph7HafI3qOITg0Mr/Hack-for-LA-Website)\r\n- [Google Drive - Hack for LA website team](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p76K0FgfiAWeIIEyoyJ_Iik8FVj8cBjT?usp=sharing)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - Dev Team Tuesday meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2010)\r\n- [Agenda / Notes - All Team meeting](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/2027)\r\n- [How to review Pull Requests](https://github.com/hackforla/website/wiki/How-to-review-pull-requests)\r\n",

An issue template and instructions will be prepared, in order to facilitate the creation of issues for performing the audit across the entire codebase.  Each new issue will audit a single file and results will be stored in the HfLA-Website: img Tag Audit spreadsheet. \r\n\r\n### Action Items\r\n- [x] Make an issue template to audit, find, and document instance of `<img.../>` in each file in the HfLA-Website: img Tag Audit spreadsheet[^1]\r\n   - [x] This issue template will include a \"Complexity: Small\" label and a \"ready for dev lead\" label along with all the other needed labels.\r\n- [x] Review and (if needed) edit the following in the HfLA-Website: img Tag Audit spreadsheet: \r\n  - [x] \"Instructions for Page Audit Issue Writers\" section on the Instructions tab [^1]\r\n  - [x] Page Audit tab [^2]. All the files that still need to be audited are already listed in the Page Audit tab.\r\n  - [x] img with Ending Slash tab [^3]. This tab contains the lines of code with <img.../> that have been found so far. This tab will also be where developers auditing the files add their findings.\r\n- [x] Use the template to make one issue as an example\r\n- [x] Get approval from a PM on the template. \r\n\r\n### Resources/Instructions\r\n[^1]: [HfLA-Website: img Tag Audit spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cq8iLOYQkAbho2GsRAxVJYgjxDeJ9KLdx2NuL4G6vu4/edit#gid=1822415835)\r\n[^2]: HfLA-Website: img Tag Audit spreadsheet's [Page Audit tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cq8iLOYQkAbho2GsRAxVJYgjxDeJ9KLdx2NuL4G6vu4/edit#gid=1277680545&fvid=1305214134)\r\n[^3]: HfLA-Website: img Tag Audit spreadsheet's [img with Ending Slash tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cq8iLOYQkAbho2GsRAxVJYgjxDeJ9KLdx2NuL4G6vu4/edit#gid=0&fvid=959329398)\r\n[^4]: Issue Template 1: [img Tag Refactor on Website](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Feature%3A+Refactor+HTML%2C+good+first+issue%2C+ready+for+dev+lead%2C+role%3A+back+end%2FdevOps%2C+role%3A+front+end%2C+size%3A+0.25pt&template=img-tag-refactor-on-website.md&title=img+Tag+Refactor%3A+%5BINSERT+PAGE+HERE%5D+page%28s%29) and its associated Markdown file [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/img-tag-refactor-on-website.md](https://github.com/hackforla/website/blob/gh-pages/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/img-tag-refactor-on-website.md). This template works for any pages that is marked with `Template 1` in the `Template to use if <img.../> found` column on the `Page Audit` tab . Template 1 works if the img tag is on the website.\r\n\r\n- This epic resulted from #4362",
